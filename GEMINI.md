# Project Summary

This is a standard Jekyll website. It appears to be the default site created by `jekyll new`.

## File Breakdown

*   **`_config.yml`**: The main configuration file for the Jekyll site. It contains global settings like the site title, description, theme, and plugins.
*   **`_posts/...`**: Blog posts, including the initial welcome post and a summary of recent site updates.
*   **`.gitignore`**: A standard Git ignore file.
*   **`404.html`**: A custom "Page Not Found" error page.
*   **`about.markdown`**: The "About" page for the site.
*   **`Gemfile`**: Manages the project's Ruby dependencies.
*   **`index.markdown`**: The main landing page of the site.
*   **`LICENSE`**: The MIT License for the project's source code.
*   **`assets/css/style.scss`**: A SASS stylesheet for custom site styling.
*   **`_includes/...`**: Local copies of the theme's `head.html`, `header.html`, and `footer.html` to allow for customization.
*   **`_layouts/default.html`**: A custom layout that overrides the theme's default to include the custom stylesheet.

## How it works

This project uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in Ruby. Content is written in Markdown, styled with SASS, and processed into a static site. The site uses the `minima` theme, but several core theme files have been overridden in the `_includes` and `_layouts` directories to allow for customization.

## Recent Changes

*   **Dark Theme & Responsive Design**: Created a custom stylesheet (`assets/css/style.scss`) and enabled the Minima theme's built-in `dark` skin in `_config.yml`.
*   **Homepage Update**: Modified `index.markdown` to include placeholder "lorem ipsum" text.
*   **Layout Overrides**: Created local copies of `default.html`, `head.html`, `header.html`, and `footer.html` to allow for direct customization and to link the custom stylesheet.
*   **New Blog Post**: Added a post summarizing the recent changes.
