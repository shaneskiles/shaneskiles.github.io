Beyond Valentinian Gnosticism, there were many other diverse Gnostic traditions and sects. These can generally be categorized by their origins and doctrines:

*   **Judean-Israelite Gnosticism:** Blended Jewish-Christian ideas with Gnostic beliefs. Examples include the **Mandaeans** and **Elkesaites**.
*   **Syriac-Egyptian Gnosticism:** Often combined Platonic philosophy with Christian themes. Notable groups include **Sethianism** (closely related to "classic Gnostics" and influential on Valentinianism), **Basilideans**, and **Thomasine traditions** (associated with texts like the Gospel of Thomas).
*   **Persian Gnosticism:** Primarily represented by **Manichaeism**, known for its strong cosmic dualism.
*   **Unclassified Christian Gnosticism:** Various groups that engaged with or diverged from early Christian thought, such as **Marcionism** (rejected the Old Testament), **Simonians** (followers of Simon Magus), **Ophites** (venerated the serpent), and **Carpocratians**.

Gnostic ideas also reappeared in medieval Europe with groups like the **Paulicians**, **Bogomils**, and **Cathars**, and there are modern **Neo-Gnostic** movements today.
