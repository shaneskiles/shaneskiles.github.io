# Project Context: Gnosticism

This file provides context for the ongoing project on Gnosticism to facilitate easy continuation in new sessions.

## Project Overview

- **Title:** Gnosticism
- **Genre:** Non-fiction, Religious Studies, Philosophy
- **Core Theme:** Exploring the historical, philosophical, and theological aspects of Gnosticism, its origins, key figures, and influence.

## Key Concepts

- **Gnosis:** Knowledge, especially esoteric knowledge of spiritual truth.
- **Demiurge:** A lesser, imperfect creator god, distinct from the true, supreme God.
- **Pleroma:** The totality of divine powers and emanations.
- **Aeons:** Divine beings or emanations within the Pleroma.
- **Dualism:** The belief in two fundamental opposing principles, often spirit vs. matter.
- **Theletos:** An Aeon representing divine will, desire, and intention, often consort of Sophia.
- **Yaldabaoth:** A specific name for the Demiurge, often depicted as a lion-faced, serpentine, ignorant, or malevolent creator.
- **Archons:** Subordinate entities to the Demiurge, who rule the material world and seek to imprison divine sparks within humanity.
- **Ophites:** Gnostic sects that venerated the serpent in Genesis as a liberator and sought gnosis to escape the Demiurge's control.

## Key Figures

- **Simon Magus**
- **Valentinus**
- **Mani (Manichaeism)**
- **Sophia:** An Aeon whose fall leads to the creation of the Demiurge and the material world.
