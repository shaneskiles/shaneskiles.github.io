**Mani** was an Iranian prophet who founded **Manichaeism** in the 3rd century CE. Born in Mesopotamia in 216 CE, Mani was raised within a Jewish-Christian Gnostic sect known as the Elcesaites. He claimed to have received profound revelations from a "heavenly twin" or spiritual guide at ages 12 and 24, which led him to believe his teachings would surpass and synthesize those of previous prophets like Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. Manichaeism subsequently developed into a distinct and highly influential Gnostic religion that spread widely across the Roman and Persian Empires.

## Manichaeism as a Gnostic Religion

Manichaeism is fundamentally a **dualistic** religion, a core characteristic it shares with many Gnostic movements. It posits a radical and eternal struggle between two co-equal, opposing principles:

*   **The Kingdom of Light:** Represented by the Father of Greatness (the supreme God), associated with spirit, goodness, and purity.
*   **The Kingdom of Darkness:** Represented by the Prince of Darkness, associated with matter, evil, and chaos.

This cosmic dualism is more pronounced than in some other Gnostic systems, where the material world is often seen as a flawed creation of an ignorant Demiurge rather than the product of an equally powerful evil force.

### Shared Gnostic Tenets:

Despite its unique features, Manichaeism shares several fundamental tenets with broader Gnostic thought:

*   **Flawed Material World:** Both Gnosticism and Manichaeism believe that the material world is inherently evil or flawed, a realm of suffering and imperfection.
*   **Divine Spark:** The human soul is understood as a "divine spark" or fragment of light from the Kingdom of Light, which has become trapped within the material body and the Kingdom of Darkness.
*   **Salvation through Gnosis:** Salvation in Manichaeism, as in other Gnostic traditions, is achieved through *gnosis*â€”special, esoteric knowledge. This knowledge allows the soul to recognize its divine origin and the true nature of the cosmos, thereby enabling its liberation and return to the Kingdom of Light.
*   **Jesus as a Revealer:** Mani viewed Jesus not primarily as a savior who died for sins, but as a divine revealer of truth, a prophet in a lineage that included Zoroaster and Buddha. Mani saw himself as the final and ultimate prophet in this line, the "Apostle of Jesus Christ."

## Distinctions and Influence

While rooted in Gnostic principles, Manichaeism developed into a highly organized and distinct religion with its own elaborate cosmology, mythology, and church structure. Key distinctions and influences include:

*   **Canonical Writings:** Mani made a deliberate effort to ensure doctrinal unity by recording his teachings in writing and giving them canonical status during his lifetime. This helped to prevent the kind of doctrinal fragmentation seen in some other Gnostic movements.
*   **Missionary Zeal:** Manichaeism was a highly missionary religion, spreading rapidly across North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and even into China. At its peak, it rivaled Christianity in its geographical reach and influence.
*   **Asceticism:** Manichaean adherents were divided into the "Elect" (who practiced strict asceticism, including vegetarianism and celibacy) and the "Hearers" (who supported the Elect and followed less stringent rules).

Manichaeism's profound dualism and its emphasis on knowledge as the path to liberation left a lasting impact on religious and philosophical thought, influencing figures like Augustine of Hippo, who was a Manichaean Hearer for a period before converting to Christianity.
