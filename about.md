Welcome to the site, my name is Shane. 

I've been a software developer (or engineer depending on who you ask)
for quite a while now - over 25 years. 
I don't write ground breaking or flashy, exciting software, but you may 
have run across some of it here and there, working quietly behind the scenes.

This space serves as my digital notebook and a place to share occasional thoughts.
You'll find a collection of technical notes, and things I find interesting.
You probably won't see many of my personal projects - most are just tinkering and 
proof of concept experiments, but some may evolve into larger projects.

This is more of a digital notebook, a place to experiment with ideas and store 
miscellaneous odds and ends. Have fun looking around, and if you find something useful,
take it and make it your own. 
If you see anything that is flat out wrong, please let me know - 
and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

Work is work and fun is fun. This is fun.
