## Space Station Adventure Ideas

### General Atmosphere:
-   **Darkness and Decay:** Many areas of the station are dimly lit or completely dark, requiring a light source. The pervasive sense of decay and disrepair adds to the tension.

### Characters:

1.  **Young Mechanic/Aspiring Pilot (Name TBD):** A young man working for Wilkins, eager to escape the station and pilot his own ship. He might be a source of information about the station's inner workings, or a potential ally/rival depending on the player's choices. He could be desperate for a way off the station and might be willing to take risks.

### Locations:

1.  **The Observation Deck (Roberts's Observatory):** A large, panoramic viewport offering stunning views of space. Often dim and quiet, a place for contemplation or clandestine meetings. Could hide hidden compartments or surveillance equipment.

2.  **Decommissioned Cargo Bay 7 (The Lacuna's Dock):** A vast, mostly empty bay with magnetic clamps and old loading equipment. Used for illicit docking or storing forgotten, potentially dangerous, cargo. Features numerous hidden access tunnels and maintenance shafts, often unlit.

3.  **The Abandoned Medbay:** Sealed off for decades, this section is dark, dusty, and filled with outdated medical equipment. Could contain old logs, forgotten experiments, or even a hidden passage to other parts of the station, including a network of maintenance tunnels.

4.  **Wilkins's General Store & Workshop:** A cluttered, makeshift shop filled with salvaged parts, questionable supplies, and recycled coffee. It's the station's unofficial hub for gossip, information, and black-market dealings. While generally lit, back rooms and storage areas are often dark and cramped.

5.  **Hydroponics Level (Old Man Hemlock's Garden):** A humid, overgrown section of the station where attempts at growing food have mostly failed. Could be a source of rare, mutated plants, a hiding spot, or a place where the station's life support systems are vulnerable. Parts of this level are unmaintained and very dark. Old Man Hemlock himself might be found here, a reclusive figure who occasionally mutters cryptic stories about Roberts and the "true nature" of the station, hinting at the Wires' influence.

### Scenario Ideas:

-   **Airlock Malfunction/Sabotage:** The player could find themselves in a situation where an airlock malfunctions or is sabotaged, leading to a sudden decompression event. This could result in being blown out into space (a potential game over or a desperate struggle for survival, similar to the Zork "You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike" scenario, but with the added threat of the void).

### Random Encounters:

1.  **Flickering Lights & Whispers:** While traversing a dark corridor, the lights flicker erratically, and the player hears faint, distorted whispers or static that seems to emanate from the station's walls. This could be a subtle hint of the Wires' presence or a psychological effect of the station's decay.

2.  **Lost Drone:** The player encounters a small, damaged maintenance drone (similar to Echo, but less sophisticated) aimlessly drifting or stuck. The player could try to repair it, salvage parts, or ignore it. Repairing it might reveal a hidden message or a new path.

3.  **Sudden Decompression Alarm:** A false alarm blares through a section of the station, causing panic among the few inhabitants. The player must quickly find cover or a safe zone, potentially leading to a new area or revealing a character's true nature under stress.

### Random NPC Encounters:

1.  **The Paranoid Scavenger:** A gaunt, jumpy individual who is constantly looking over their shoulder. They might offer a piece of seemingly nonsensical information about the Wires or a hidden cache, but only if the player can gain their trust or offer something valuable.

2.  **The Desperate Trader:** A haggard merchant trying to offload questionable goods (e.g., expired rations, faulty equipment, or even illicit data chips). They might offer a crucial item or a clue in exchange for something the player possesses, or if the player helps them with a small task.

3.  **The Silent Observer:** A figure who appears to be watching the player from a distance, never directly engaging. They might be a loyalist of the Wires, another sleepwalker, or simply a curious inhabitant. Their presence could create a sense of unease or hint at being monitored.
