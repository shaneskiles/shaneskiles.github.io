"The unique challenges of acquiring analog tech from these places?" Wilkins shrugs. "The challenge is finding them, and then convincing the inhabitants to part with their treasures. They're wary of outsiders, and they don't trust easily. You'd have to prove yourself, demonstrate your commitment to staying off-grid. And the journey itself is dangerous, through uncharted space, past Wire patrols. But if you can make a connection, you might find something truly valuable, something the Wires have long forgotten."
