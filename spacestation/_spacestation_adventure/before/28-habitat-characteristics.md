"Habitat characteristics?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're all different, but they share a common thread: a desire for independence. The level of Wire influence is minimal, if not entirely absent. They run on old, patched-together systems, often powered by salvaged reactors. Their primary industries are usually resource extraction, illicit trade, or specialized research that the Wires wouldn't approve of. They're self-sufficient, but also isolated. They rely on each other for trade and information, but they're wary of outsiders. It's a hard life, but a free one."
