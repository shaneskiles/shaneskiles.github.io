"The Veil Nebula," Wilkins says, a distant look in his eyes. "It's a beautiful, deadly place. The gas and dust clouds are so dense, they absorb and scatter most electromagnetic signals. The Wires' long-range comms just can't penetrate it. It's like a natural shield. But it's also full of unpredictable energy surges, rogue gravitational eddies, and pockets of corrosive gas. One wrong move, and your ship could be torn apart, or your systems fried. It's a place for desperate people, or those with nothing left to lose."
