"The nature of illicit transfers?" Wilkins leans in, his voice a low murmur. "Anything the Wires have deemed illegal. Unsanctioned tech, forbidden data, rare minerals, even certain types of information. It's usually moved under the cover of darkness, or during a shift change when the Wires' monitoring is less vigilant. The risks are high: Wire patrols, rival traders, even just a faulty airlock. But for those who value freedom over compliance, these transfers are a lifeline. It's a constant dance, a game of cat and mouse with the Wires."
