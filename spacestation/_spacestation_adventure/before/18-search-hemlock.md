You begin to search the overgrown Hydroponics Level for Old Man Hemlock. The air is thick and humid, and the dim light makes it difficult to see clearly. You navigate through tangles of withered vines and strange, mutated flora, calling out his name softly. The silence of the level is broken only by the drip of water and the rustle of unseen things. You wonder if he's truly here, or if he's just a legend whispered among the station's few inhabitants.
