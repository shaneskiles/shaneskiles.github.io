"Off-station analog tech is a different story," Wilkins explains. "The fringe habitats, like the Tangle, are your best bet. They actively seek out and trade in old-world tech. You'll find everything from pre-Collapse comms arrays to ancient mechanical computers. It's not cheap, mind you. And getting there is half the battle. But if you need reliable, Wire-proof tech, those are the places to go. Just be prepared to trade, or to work for it. Nothing comes free out there."
