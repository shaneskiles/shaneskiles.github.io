"The typical cost of analog tech?" Wilkins sighs. "It varies wildly, writer. Rarity, condition, functionality, all play a part. A working pre-Collapse comms unit could fetch a small fortune. A broken one, just a few credits for parts. And then there's the seller. Some are fair, others will try to bleed you dry. It's a buyer beware market, and you need to know your stuff, or you'll get fleeced. But whatever the price, it's worth it for the freedom it offers. The Wires can't touch you when you're running on old-world tech."
