"Navigating the Tangle's chaotic structure?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's a nightmare, writer. No two paths are the same, and it's constantly shifting as new sections are added or old ones break off. There are no official maps, and the Wires' sensors are useless in there. You navigate by landmarks, by the smell of recycled air, by the faint hum of ancient machinery. It's easy to get lost, and even easier to stumble into trouble. But if you know your way around, you can find hidden markets, secret docks, and places where the Wires' influence is completely absent."
