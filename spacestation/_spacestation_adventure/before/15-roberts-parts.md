You sift through the salvaged parts, specifically looking for anything that might be related to Roberts or his ship, the *Lacuna*. Most of the components are standard station-issue, but you spot a few pieces that seem... different. A section of matte-black plating, unusually smooth and seamless, and a small, intricate power conduit that doesn't match any known schematics. Wilkins watches you from his counter, his expression unreadable. You wonder if these are indeed parts from Roberts's elusive vessel.
