"The level of Wire influence in these habitats?" Wilkins shrugs. "Minimal, if not entirely absent. They run on old, patched-together systems, often powered by salvaged reactors. The Wires try to extend their reach, of course. They send their probes, their informants, their digital chatter. But these habitats are designed to resist. They have their own networks, their own ways of communicating, their own defenses. It's a constant struggle, but they've managed to maintain their independence. It's a hard life, but a free one."
