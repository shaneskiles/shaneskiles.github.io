You sift through the salvaged parts, looking for anything that could be useful for your own purposes. Your datapad is blank, and a communication scrambler would be invaluable if you plan to operate outside the Wires' network. You scan the various components, trying to identify anything that might fit your needs. The sheer volume of junk is overwhelming, but you know that hidden within it could be the key to your next step.
