"Rumored survivors from the medbay?" Wilkins scoffs. "Fairy tales, mostly. If anyone survived, they wouldn't be the same. The Wires made sure of that. But there are whispers, always whispers. Of people who emerged from the medbay, changed. Mumbling about voices, about the Wires, about things they shouldn't have seen. Some say they became... sleepwalkers, like Roberts. Others say they were just broken. Whatever the truth, the Wires don't want anyone looking too closely. They want that medbay forgotten."
