You decide to try and force open the heavily sealed Medbay door. It's old, rusted, and clearly hasn't been opened in a very long time. You brace yourself against the bulkhead and push, then pull, then try to wedge your datapad into the seam. The metal groans in protest, and dust motes dance in the faint light. The door is stubborn, a testament to its decades of disuse. You wonder if the effort is worth the potential risks of entering such a long-abandoned section.
