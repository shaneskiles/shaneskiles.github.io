"Communication scramblers, blockers..." Wilkins nods. "I get 'em in sometimes. Old tech, mostly. Not perfect, but they can make you a lot harder to track. They scramble your comms, make your data look like static. The Wires can still detect a signal, but they can't decipher it. It's a cat-and-mouse game, always. They upgrade their tech, we find new ways to hide. But it's better than nothing. Gives you a little breathing room."
