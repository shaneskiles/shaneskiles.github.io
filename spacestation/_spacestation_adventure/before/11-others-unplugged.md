"Others tried?" Wilkins snorts, a grim look on his face. "Plenty. Most of 'em ended up like old man Hemlock, muttering to himself in the hydroponics bay. Or worse. The Wires don't take kindly to insubordination. They'll make an example of you, one way or another. Roberts is... an anomaly. He's smarter, or luckier, than most. Or maybe he just found a better way to hide." He shakes his head. "It's a lonely path, writer. And a dangerous one."
