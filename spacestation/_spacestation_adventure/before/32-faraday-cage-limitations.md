"The limitations of Faraday cages?" Wilkins shakes his head. "They're not foolproof. A strong enough pulse can still get through, especially if there are any gaps or weak points in the shielding. And they only protect against electromagnetic fields, not physical impacts or direct energy weapons. It's a trade-off, writer. You either risk your tech, or you go dark. There's no foolproof way to protect everything when you're playing with that kind of power. But a well-built Faraday cage can give you a fighting chance, a moment of silence from the Wires."
