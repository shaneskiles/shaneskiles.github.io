"The plague or experiment..." Wilkins shivers, a genuine tremor this time. "No one knows for sure. The official story is a highly contagious, fast-acting plague that wiped out everyone in the medbay. But the whispers say it was an experiment. An attempt to integrate human consciousness directly with the Wires, to create a perfect, compliant society. They say it went horribly wrong. Minds shattered, bodies twisted. Whatever it was, the Wires sealed it off, and they've kept it sealed. They don't want anyone to know the truth."
