"The risks of scavenging in these bays?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's a long shot, and often dangerous. Unstable structures, environmental hazards, even dormant automated defenses. And then there are the other scavengers, the rival traders. They're just as desperate as you are, and they won't hesitate to cut your throat for a valuable find. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the stakes are high. One wrong move, and you could end up in a Wire detention center, or worse, floating in the void."
