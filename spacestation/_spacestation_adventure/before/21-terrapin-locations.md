"On Terrapin itself?" Wilkins gestures vaguely around his cluttered shop. "Well, this place, for one. Too much junk, too many signals bouncing around. The Wires don't like it. Then there are the old cargo bays, especially Bay 7. Used to be a major hub, now it's mostly decommissioned. Lots of dead zones there. And the abandoned medbay, sealed off for decades. No active systems, just dust and ghosts. Those are your best bets for a quiet corner, if you're looking to hide."
