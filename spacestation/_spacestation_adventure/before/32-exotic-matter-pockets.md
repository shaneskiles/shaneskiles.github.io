"Exotic matter pockets?" Wilkins shakes his head. "Strange particles that distort space-time and scramble signals. They're like invisible whirlpools, pulling at your ship, twisting your comms. They're rare, and highly unpredictable. One wrong move, and your ship could be torn apart, or flung into another dimension. They're dangerous, and usually far off the beaten path. But if you can navigate them, they offer a level of anonymity that the Wires can't penetrate."
