You carefully sift through the salvaged parts, trying to identify any valuable or unique components. Your knowledge of Martian colony tech is limited, but you recognize some basic power converters, comms relays, and structural plating. Most of it looks like junk, but a few pieces seem to be in surprisingly good condition, or at least, salvageable. You wonder what Wilkins charges for this stuff, and if any of it could be useful to you on your quest.
