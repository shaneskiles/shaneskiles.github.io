You decide to call out softly into the darkness of the observation deck. Your voice, though quiet, echoes unnervingly in the profound silence. "Hello? Is anyone here?" The words hang in the air, then dissipate, leaving only the hum of the station. You strain your ears, listening for any response, any subtle shift in the atmosphere. The silence that follows is heavy, making you wonder if you're truly alone, or if someone is listening, choosing not to respond.
