"Specialized knowledge or tools required?" Wilkins nods. "You'd need to be a tech-head, someone who understands ancient operating systems and forgotten protocols. And specialized tools: data extractors, interface adapters, even old-world decryption keys. These aren't things you can find at any shop. You'd have to scavenge them, or trade for them on the black market. It's a long shot, and often dangerous, but if you can get your hands on them, you might unlock the secrets of the past, secrets the Wires want to keep buried."
