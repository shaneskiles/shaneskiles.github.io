"Those who disappeared?" Wilkins shakes his head, a somber look on his face. "No trace. Their ships just... vanished. No distress signals, no debris. It's like they were erased from existence. Some say the Wires have a way of doing that, of making you truly disappear. Others think they just found a way to escape, to go somewhere the Wires can't reach. But I don't know. It's a mystery. And mysteries out here usually end badly."
