The shuttle from the Phobos transit hub was little more than a tin can, a relic of a bygone era. You, a writer from the climate-controlled domes of Mars, have endured the journey to Terrapin Station, a forgotten pinprick in areostationary orbit. You're chasing a ghost, a whisper about a man named Roberts, a "sleepwalker." The station's automated airlock hisses open, revealing a world bathed in the dim, red glow of emergency lighting. The air is thin, tasting of ozone and old metal. This is a place forgotten by its creators, left to slowly crumble in the eternal twilight of orbit. You feel like an intruder, clumsy and loud in this realm of silence and decay. Your datapad is blank, for the story you seek can only be found in experience.
