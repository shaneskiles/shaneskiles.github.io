You decide to try and find a better light source within the dark tunnel. Your datapad's beam is insufficient, and the oppressive gloom is making you uneasy. You sweep your light along the walls, looking for any emergency lights, power conduits, or discarded equipment that might still hold a charge. The air is cold and still, and the sounds of the tunnel seem to amplify your own breathing. You know that navigating this area without proper illumination could be dangerous.
