"The *Lacuna*..." Wilkins's eyes gleam with a mix of awe and frustration. "It's a marvel, writer. Seamless, matte-black, drinks the light. It's not just stealthy; it's practically invisible to conventional sensors. Roberts built it to be a ghost in the void. I've seen it up close, worked on a few of its salvaged components. It doesn't have a conventional engine, not like anything I've ever seen. It just... moves. Like a thought. It's a ship designed for silence, for disappearing."
