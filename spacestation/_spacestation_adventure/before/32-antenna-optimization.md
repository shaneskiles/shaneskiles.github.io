"Optimizing antenna configurations?" Wilkins nods. "That's a science in itself. It's about matching the antenna to the frequency, about minimizing interference, about maximizing signal strength. It requires a deep understanding of electromagnetism, of wave propagation. Most people these days wouldn't know where to begin. But if you can squeeze every last bit of performance out of an old antenna, you can extend your range, improve your clarity. It's a constant battle against the limitations of analog tech. But every extra light-year you can squeeze out of it is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
