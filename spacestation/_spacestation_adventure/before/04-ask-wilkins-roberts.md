You lean closer to Wilkins, lowering your voice. "I'm looking for a man named Roberts. They call him a 'sleepwalker'. Do you know anything about him?" Wilkins's shrewd eyes narrow slightly, and he lets out a dry chuckle that sounds like grinding metal. "You don't look like you're here to retire. You're either running from something, or you're looking for something. Given you came here, I'm betting on the latter."

"I'm a writer," you say.

"A writer, eh?" Wilkins's expression doesn't change, but a flicker of something—amusement, perhaps—dances in his eyes. "Well, I'll be. We don't get many of your kind out here. Too quiet for most. As for Roberts... you're not the first to ask. He's become something of a local legend. The man who truly unplugged. Not just from the data streams, but from the Wires themselves." He taps a nearby conduit conspiratorially. "Thinks they're always listening. And they are. So we try not to give them anything worth hearing." He pauses, sizing you up. "Why him?"
