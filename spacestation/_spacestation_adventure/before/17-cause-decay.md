"Cause of the decay?" The young mechanic shrugs. "Time, mostly. This station's ancient. But also... neglect. The Wires decided Terrapin wasn't 'efficient' enough anymore, so they stopped sending proper maintenance crews, stopped supplying new parts. They just let it rot. It's a slow death, but it's a death all the same. They want us to leave, to go to their shiny new stations. But some of us... we'd rather stay here, even if it's falling apart."
