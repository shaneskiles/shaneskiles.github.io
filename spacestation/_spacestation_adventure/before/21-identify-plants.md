You attempt to identify the mutated plant species, comparing them to the limited botanical data on your datapad. Their forms are so distorted that it's difficult to match them to any known terrestrial or Martian flora. The faint glow and strange scent suggest something entirely new, or perhaps a highly evolved mutation. You wonder if these plants are dangerous, or if they hold some unique properties. The humid air and the rustle of unseen things add to the unsettling atmosphere.
