"The tools for manual navigation?" Wilkins gestures to a dusty corner of his shop. "A good star chart, for one. Not a digital one, mind you. A physical map of the constellations, the nebulae, the known gravitational anomalies. Then there's a sextant. An ancient device, but still effective. You use it to measure the angles between celestial bodies, to plot your position. And a good chronometer, to keep track of time. It's all about precision, about observation, about trusting your own senses over the Wires' manipulated data. It's slow, but it's true."
