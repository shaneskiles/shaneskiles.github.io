You pick up a particularly intricate piece of salvaged machinery, a complex array of circuits and conduits. It looks like it could be valuable, but your knowledge of station tech is limited. You wonder if Wilkins would give you an honest appraisal, or if he'd try to lowball you. You could also try to research its value on your datapad, though you're unsure how reliable the station's network is for such information.
