"Opportunities to leave?" The young mechanic's face darkens. "Not many, not for folks like us. The Wires keep a tight leash on all official transport. You need permits, clearances, and a reason they approve of. Most of the ships that come and go are corporate, or military. They don't take passengers. Unless..." He trails off, glancing around Wilkins's shop, as if afraid of being overheard. "Unless you know the right people. Or you're willing to take a risk."
