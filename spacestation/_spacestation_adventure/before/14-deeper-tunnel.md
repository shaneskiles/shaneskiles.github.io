You decide to proceed deeper into the darkness of the maintenance tunnel. The air grows heavier, and the sounds of dripping water and scuttling creatures become more pronounced. Your datapad's light struggles against the gloom, creating dancing shadows that play tricks on your eyes. The tunnel seems to stretch endlessly, a forgotten artery of the station. You feel a growing sense of isolation, and the thought of what might be lurking in the unseen depths sends a shiver down your spine.
