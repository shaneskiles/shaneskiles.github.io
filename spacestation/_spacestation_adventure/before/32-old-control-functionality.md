"The functionality of these old controls?" Wilkins nods. "They're basic, but they work. No digital interference, no Wire backdoors. They're designed for direct control, for a pilot who trusts their own hands over an algorithm. They're rare, and often in need of repair, but they offer a level of control and security that modern systems can't match. It's a dying art, operating these things, but a vital one."
