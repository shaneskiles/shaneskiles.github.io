You sweep your datapad's light across the entire area, trying to get a comprehensive view of the hidden corners of the observation deck. The beam reveals a chaotic jumble of discarded equipment, old wiring, and structural supports. Dust motes dance in the light, creating a hazy, ethereal atmosphere. The sheer amount of forgotten material is overwhelming, and you realize that finding anything specific will be a challenge. The silence of the room is profound, making you feel like you're exploring a forgotten tomb.
