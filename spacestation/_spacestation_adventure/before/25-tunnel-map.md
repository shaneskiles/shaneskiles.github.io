You decide to look for a map or schematics of the tunnel system. You sweep your datapad's light along the walls, searching for any old diagrams or signs. The tunnels are a chaotic maze, and you know that getting lost here could be dangerous. You also consider trying to access station schematics on your datapad, though you're unsure how reliable the network is in these forgotten areas. You need a guide, something to help you navigate this labyrinth.
