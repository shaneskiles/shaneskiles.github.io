"The dangers of scavenging in the medbay?" Wilkins shivers. "The Wires sealed it off for a reason, and whatever happened in there... it left its mark. Lingering biological agents, unstable experimental equipment, even the ghosts of those who died there. You might find what you're looking for, but you might also find something you wish you hadn't. It's a place where sanity goes to die, writer. Best to leave it alone."
