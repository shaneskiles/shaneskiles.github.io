"Maneuverability mods?" Wilkins nods. "You'll need more than just a fresh coat of paint. Enhanced thrusters, for one. You need to be able to change direction on a dime, dodge incoming rocks. And advanced gyroscopic stabilizers, to keep your ship steady in chaotic environments. It's expensive, and it adds weight, but it's the difference between surviving an asteroid field and becoming part of it. And even with all that, you still need a pilot who knows what they're doing."
