"Shielded backups or off-grid storage?" Wilkins nods. "That's the only way to truly protect your data. A Faraday-caged hard drive, an old-world data chip stored in a lead-lined box. Or better yet, physical copies, printed out and hidden away. And off-grid storage, places where the Wires can't reach, like the Tangle or a hidden asteroid base. It's a lot of work, and it's never foolproof. But if you want to keep your secrets safe from the Wires, you have to go analog, and you have to go dark."
