"The learning curve for operating old comms?" Wilkins chuckles. "It's steep, writer. Most people these days wouldn't know where to begin. You need to understand frequencies, modulation, signal strength. You need to have a feel for the static, to know when it's just interference and when it's a message trying to break through. It's a skill, a craft. There aren't many resources out there, no official manuals. You learn by doing, by trial and error, or if you're lucky, by finding someone who still remembers the old ways. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
