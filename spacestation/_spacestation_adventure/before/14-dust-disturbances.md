You meticulously examine the dust on the floor for any disturbances. The layer is thick and undisturbed in most places, but you notice a faint, almost imperceptible trail of disturbed dust leading from the entrance to the center of the room, and then back towards the viewport. It's not a clear footprint, but a subtle disruption, as if something light and ethereal has passed through. You wonder if this is the path Roberts takes, or if it's a sign of something else entirely.
