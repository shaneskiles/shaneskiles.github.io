"The old research labs?" Wilkins shrugs. "Used to be a hub of innovation, they said. Developing new tech, new life support systems, even some experimental propulsion. But then the Wires decided all that independent research was 'inefficient'. They centralized everything, brought it under their control. So the labs here were shut down, left to gather dust. Who knows what they were working on in there. Or what they left behind."
