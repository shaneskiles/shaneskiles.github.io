"The primary industries or activities in these habitats?" Wilkins nods. "Resource extraction, mostly. Mining rare minerals, harvesting exotic gases. Things the Wires need but can't easily control. Then there's illicit trade. Anything that doesn't pass through official channels. And specialized research, things the Wires wouldn't approve of. New technologies, forbidden data, even attempts to understand the Wires themselves. It's a dangerous life, but a profitable one for those who are willing to take the risks."
