"Components for building an EMP?" Wilkins scratches his chin. "The high-capacity capacitors are the hardest to find. They're heavily regulated, used in power conduits and industrial machinery. You'd have to scavenge them from decommissioned sections, or buy them on the black market, which is risky. The electromagnetic coil is easier, you can salvage one from an old thruster or a power generator. And the trigger mechanism, that's just basic electronics. But putting it all together, making it work without blowing yourself up... that's the real challenge."
