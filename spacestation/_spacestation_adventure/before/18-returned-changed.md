"Those who returned changed?" Wilkins shudders slightly. "They're the worst, writer. They look like themselves, but their eyes... they're empty. They just sit there, muttering code, or repeating phrases from the Wires' propaganda. It's like their minds have been rewired, their spirits broken. They're living warnings, you see. A message from the Wires: 'This is what happens when you try to defy us.' It's a fate worse than death, if you ask me."
