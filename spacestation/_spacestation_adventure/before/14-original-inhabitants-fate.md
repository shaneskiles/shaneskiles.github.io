"The original inhabitants?" Wilkins shrugs. "Most of 'em left. Went to the corporate stations, became good little cogs in the Wires' machine. Traded their freedom for comfort, their independence for efficiency. A few stayed, the stubborn ones, the ones who valued the quiet more than the noise. We're the ghosts of what used to be, writer. Living relics of a bygone era. We chose to rot in freedom rather than thrive in a cage."
