"Building an effective Faraday cage?" Wilkins nods. "You need conductive materials: copper mesh, aluminum foil, even a thick layer of salvaged metal plating. And it has to be perfect, no gaps, no weak points. Every seam, every opening, has to be sealed. And it needs to be properly grounded. It's a precise job, and even then, a strong enough pulse can still get through. But a well-built Faraday cage can give you a fighting chance, a moment of silence from the Wires."
