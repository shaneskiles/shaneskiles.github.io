"The types of people living in the Tangle?" Wilkins shrugs. "A motley crew. Scavengers, independent traders, exiles, those who just want to be left alone. People who don't fit into the Wires' neat little society. They're fiercely independent, and they don't trust outsiders easily. But if you earn their respect, they can be valuable allies. They know how to survive off-grid, how to make a living without the Wires' interference. Just don't expect any official welcome. The Tangle operates on its own rules, and those rules are often unwritten."
