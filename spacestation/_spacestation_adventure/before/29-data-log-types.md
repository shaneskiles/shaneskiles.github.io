"Types of data logs that might exist?" Wilkins's eyes gleam with a hint of avarice. "Medical records, research notes, even personal diaries of the station's original inhabitants. Information the Wires deemed irrelevant, or dangerous. It could be anything from the true history of the station to blueprints for forbidden technology. It's all valuable, all dangerous. And all worth risking your neck for, if you're brave enough to dig through the digital dust."
