You continue to wait in the observation deck for several more hours. The silence is broken only by the distant hum of the station and the occasional creak of stressed metal. The stars remain a silent, glittering tapestry. You feel a growing sense of doubt. Has Roberts already left? Is he even real? The vastness of the void outside seems to mock your patience, and the thought of wasting more time here is becoming unbearable.
