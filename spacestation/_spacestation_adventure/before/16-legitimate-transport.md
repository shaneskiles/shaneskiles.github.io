"Legitimate transport?" The young mechanic scoffs. "There's barely any. The Wires control all the major routes. You need permits, clearances, and a reason they approve of. Most of the ships that come and go are corporate, or military. They don't take passengers, not unless you're a high-value asset, or you're being 'relocated' for 'optimization'. It's a closed system, writer. They don't want anyone leaving without their say-so."
