"Bay 7's current status?" Wilkins shrugs. "Mostly quiet. It's officially decommissioned, so the Wires don't bother with it much. That's why it's a good spot for... unsanctioned activities. You might find a few independent traders using it for temporary storage, or a ship docking illicitly. But it's not monitored like the active bays. Just be careful. 'Decommissioned' doesn't mean 'empty'. And some of the things stored there might not appreciate being disturbed."
