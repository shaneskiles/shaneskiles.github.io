"The fate of those who entered the medbay after it was sealed?" Wilkins shakes his head. "None of them ever came back the same. Some disappeared entirely, swallowed by the darkness, or perhaps by whatever lurks within. Others returned... changed. Mumbling about voices, about the Wires, about things they shouldn't have seen. Their minds shattered, their bodies twisted. The medbay has a way of getting inside your head, writer. Best to leave it alone. It's a place where sanity goes to die."
