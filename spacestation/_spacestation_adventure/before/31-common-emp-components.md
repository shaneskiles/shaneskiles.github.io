"Common components affected by EMPs?" Wilkins taps a finger on his counter. "Microchips, circuit boards, anything with delicate electronics. The EMP can literally burn them out, melt wires, even crack the chips themselves. Power supplies and batteries can also be affected, leading to complete device failure. It's not just a software issue; it's a hardware failure. Repairing it is often impossible, and replacing components can be expensive and difficult. It's a harsh lesson, writer. When you use an EMP, you're not just disrupting the Wires; you're disrupting everything digital around you."
