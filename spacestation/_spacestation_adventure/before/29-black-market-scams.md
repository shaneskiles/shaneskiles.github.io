"Common scams or traps on the black market?" Wilkins shakes his head slowly. "Where do I begin? Faulty goods, inflated prices, outright ambushes. They'll sell you a broken device, or a data chip filled with useless information. Or they'll set you up, lead you into a trap, and then rob you blind. You have to be constantly on your guard, trust no one. And even then, it's a gamble. The black market is a cesspool, and you're just another fish in the barrel. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the house always wins."
