"Reinforced plating and shielding?" Wilkins taps a finger on his counter. "Asteroids aren't soft, writer. You need more than standard hull. Ablative armor, for one. It burns away on impact, dissipating the energy. And a good deflector shield, something that can absorb impacts without failing. It's expensive, and it adds weight, but it's the difference between surviving a field and becoming part of it. And even with all that, you still need a pilot who knows what they're doing."
