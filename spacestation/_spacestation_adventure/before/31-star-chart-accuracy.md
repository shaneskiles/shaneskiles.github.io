"The accuracy and reliability of old star charts?" Wilkins gestures to a rolled-up parchment on his desk. "They're old, some of them centuries old, but they're true. No Wire can manipulate them, no algorithm can distort them. They're a direct link to the cosmos, to the raw, unfiltered truth of space. But they require a skilled hand to read, and a keen eye to interpret. And you have to account for stellar drift, for the subtle shifts in the constellations over time. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
