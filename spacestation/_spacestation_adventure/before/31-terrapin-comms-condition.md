"The condition of old comms found on Terrapin?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're usually in rough shape. Decades of neglect, dust, and the Wires' constant chatter have taken their toll. You might find a broken antenna, a corroded circuit board, or a power supply that's long dead. It takes a lot of work to get them operational, and even then, they're finicky. But they're pure. No digital interference, no Wire backdoors. They're a direct link to the past, and a potential lifeline for the future."
