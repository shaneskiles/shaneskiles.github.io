"Using signal boosters or relays to extend comms range?" Wilkins scratches his beard. "They can help, but they're rare and draw attention. A signal booster amplifies your signal, pushing it further. A relay station acts as a hop, extending your reach. But both are highly regulated by the Wires, and using them without authorization is a quick way to get noticed. And even if you find one, they're often old, unreliable, and prone to failure. It's a constant battle against the limitations of analog tech. But every extra light-year you can squeeze out of it is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
