"Standard security drones?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're everywhere, patrolling the station, monitoring comms. They're mostly for show, designed to deter petty crime and keep the peace. They have basic sensors, a limited range, and usually non-lethal deterrents. They're easily avoided if you know what you're doing. But they're also the Wires' eyes and ears. They report everything back to the central network. So even if you disable one, the Wires will know you were there. It's a constant game of cat and mouse."
