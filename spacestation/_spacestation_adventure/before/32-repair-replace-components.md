"Repairing or replacing damaged components?" Wilkins sighs. "It's often impossible. The EMP can literally burn out circuits, melt wires, even crack microchips. Repairing that kind of damage requires specialized tools and knowledge, and often, the components themselves are irreplaceable. Sourcing replacements can be a nightmare. Most of them aren't manufactured anymore. You have to scavenge them, or trade for them on the black market. It's a harsh lesson, writer. When you use an EMP, you're not just disrupting the Wires; you're disrupting everything digital around you."
