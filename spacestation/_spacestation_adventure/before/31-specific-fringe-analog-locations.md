"Specific other fringe habitats for analog tech?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're out there, scattered across the void. Smaller outposts, hidden away in asteroid fields or nebulae. They might not have the sheer volume of the Tangle, but they often have specialized pieces, unique relics from before the Collapse. The challenge is finding them, and then convincing the inhabitants to part with their treasures. They're wary of outsiders, and they don't trust easily. But if you can make a connection, you might find something truly valuable, something the Wires have long forgotten."
