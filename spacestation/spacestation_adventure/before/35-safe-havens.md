"Finding safe havens during a crackdown?" Wilkins nods. "You need places the Wires don't monitor, places they don't care about. Old maintenance tunnels, decommissioned cargo bays, even some of the older, unmaintained residential blocks. Hidden rooms, secret compartments, places you can seal yourself off from the network. It's about becoming invisible, about disappearing from their sight. But even then, you can't stay there forever. They'll eventually find you, or starve you out. It's a temporary refuge, a place to weather the storm."
