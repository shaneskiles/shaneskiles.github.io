"Surviving a Wire crackdown?" Wilkins leans in, his voice low. "You go dark, writer. You cut off all digital connections, you hide in the blind spots, and you rely on your own wits. You need to have a plan, a safe haven, and enough supplies to last. The Wires will try to flush you out, to make you desperate. They'll cut off power, restrict movement, even spread false information to sow panic. It's a test of endurance, a battle of wills. But if you can outlast them, if you can remain silent, you might just make it through. It's a hard life, but a free one."
