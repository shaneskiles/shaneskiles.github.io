"Acquiring or creating star charts?" Wilkins shrugs. "Finding old ones is rare, but possible. You might stumble upon them in forgotten archives, or trade for them on the black market. Creating new ones is a massive undertaking. It requires a deep understanding of astronomy, of celestial mechanics, and a lot of patience. But it's the only way to truly go off-grid, to navigate without the Wires' manipulated data. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
