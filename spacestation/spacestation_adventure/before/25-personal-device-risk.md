"Your personal devices?" Wilkins shakes his head grimly. "An EMP doesn't discriminate, writer. Anything digital in the blast radius is going to be fried. Your datapad, your comms unit, even the implants some folks have. It's a complete wipe. You'd be back to square one, relying on analog tech and your own wits. Some people try to shield their devices, but it's never foolproof. It's a sacrifice you make, a price you pay for that moment of silence from the Wires."
