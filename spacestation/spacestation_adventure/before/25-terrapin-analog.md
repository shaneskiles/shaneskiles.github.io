"Finding analog tech on Terrapin?" Wilkins scratches his beard. "It's like looking for a needle in a haystack, but the haystack is made of scrap metal. Your best bet is the older, unmonitored sections. The abandoned medbay, for sure. Or some of the deeper, decommissioned cargo bays. Scavengers sometimes pull old comms units or manual control panels out of there. It's rare, and usually in rough shape, but it's out there. You just have to be willing to dig through a lot of junk, and avoid the Wires' patrols."
