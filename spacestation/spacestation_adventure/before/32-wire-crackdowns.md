"Wire crackdowns and patrols?" Wilkins nods grimly. "They're always watching. They have their own informants, their own agents, even their own automated systems monitoring the black market. They'll let you make your deal, let you think you're safe, and then they'll swoop in. They don't care about the petty crimes; they care about anything that disrupts their control. And the black market is a prime source of such disruptions. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the house always wins. One wrong move, and you could end up in a Wire detention center, or worse, floating in the void."
