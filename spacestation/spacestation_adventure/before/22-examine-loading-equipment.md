You approach the old loading equipment in Cargo Bay 7, its massive robotic arms and magnetic clamps covered in a thick layer of dust. It looks like it hasn't been used in decades, yet there's a faint, almost imperceptible hum coming from its core. You run your hand along the cold metal, feeling for any signs of recent activity. You wonder if this equipment could still be operational, and if it was used for something other than its intended purpose.
