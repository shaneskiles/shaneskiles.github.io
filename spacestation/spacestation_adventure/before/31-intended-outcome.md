"The intended outcome of the experiment?" Wilkins's voice is cold. "They were trying to 'optimize' human consciousness, to integrate us more fully with the Wires. To eliminate dissent, to control every thought, every emotion. They wanted a perfect, compliant society, where everyone was connected, everyone was controlled. They believed it was for our own good, for the good of the collective. But it went horribly wrong. Minds shattered, bodies twisted. The subjects became... something else. Not human, not Wire. Just broken."
