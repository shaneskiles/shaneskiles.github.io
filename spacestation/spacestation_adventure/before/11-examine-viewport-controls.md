You carefully examine the viewport's controls, running your fingers over the smooth, cold surface. There are no obvious buttons or interfaces, just a seamless expanse of plasteel. You tap and press, looking for any hidden pressure plates or holographic projections. The silence of the observation deck is absolute, making you hyper-aware of every subtle sound. You wonder if the viewport is simply a window, or if it has some hidden function, perhaps a way to communicate with the outside, or even control something.
