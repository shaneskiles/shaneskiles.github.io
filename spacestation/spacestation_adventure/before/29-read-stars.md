"Learning to read the stars?" Wilkins smiles, a rare, genuine smile. "It's more than just knowing their names, writer. It's about understanding their movements, their patterns, their subtle shifts. It's about identifying constellations, recognizing individual stars, and using them as your guide. It's a constant mental exercise, a dance with the void. Most pilots these days rely on the Wires' automation, but a true navigator trusts their own instincts. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
