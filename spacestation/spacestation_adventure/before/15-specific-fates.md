"Specific examples?" Wilkins sighs, a heavy sound in the quiet shop. "There was a freighter pilot, a good man, named Kael. Went off the grid, swore he'd found a way to bypass the Wires' tracking. Vanished without a trace. His ship, his cargo, him... gone. And then there's Lena. She was a brilliant data analyst, tried to expose some of the Wires' manipulations. They didn't kill her. They just... broke her mind. She's still on a station somewhere, muttering code that makes no sense. A living ghost. The Wires are thorough, writer. They don't leave loose ends."
