"Reading asteroid field currents?" Wilkins nods. "Asteroid fields aren't static; they have their own internal movements, their own flows. A good pilot can feel them, anticipate them, and use them to their advantage. It's all about instinct, about trusting your gut, not some Wire-controlled navigation system. You can use the currents to slingshot yourself, to gain speed, or to evade pursuit. It's a dangerous dance, but if you master it, you can go where the Wires can't follow, and where no automated system would dare."
