"Wire surveillance and interception of cargo?" Wilkins shakes his head. "They're always watching. They have their own network of informants, their own automated systems. High-resolution cameras, motion sensors, biometric scanners. They'll track anything that moves, anything that could disrupt their control. They'll intercept suspicious shipments, reroute them, or just make them disappear. It's a constant game of cat and mouse, writer. And the Wires have infinite resources, but you have something they don't: ingenuity. And the element of surprise."
