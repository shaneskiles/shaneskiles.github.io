"Personal data manipulation?" Wilkins's eyes darken. "They build profiles on everyone, writer. Your habits, your preferences, your thoughts. They use it to 'optimize' your life, to guide your choices. They'll suggest jobs, housing, even relationships, all based on what they deem 'efficient' for the system. And if you deviate... if you show signs of dissent, or independence... they can make your life very difficult. Lost job opportunities, denied travel permits, even subtle social ostracization. They don't need to use force. They just need to control your options."
