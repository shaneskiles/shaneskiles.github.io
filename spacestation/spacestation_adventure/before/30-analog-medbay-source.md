"The abandoned medbay as a source for analog tech?" Wilkins shivers slightly. "It's sealed off for decades, but some scavengers have managed to get in. They say you can find old diagnostic tools, manual surgical instruments, even some pre-Collapse medical equipment. It's all analog, no Wire connection. But it's a dangerous place. The Wires sealed it off for a reason, and whatever happened in there... it left its mark. You might find what you're looking for, but you might also find something you wish you hadn't."
