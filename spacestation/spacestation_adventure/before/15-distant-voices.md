You strain your ears, trying to discern any distant voices or conversations. The station's hum makes it difficult, but you occasionally catch faint, muffled sounds that suggest human speech. It's too indistinct to make out words, but the presence of voices indicates an inhabited area. You wonder who these people are, and if they might be a source of information, or a potential threat. The silence of the station makes these distant sounds all the more intriguing.
