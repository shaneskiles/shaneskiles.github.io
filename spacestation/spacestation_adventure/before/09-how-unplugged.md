"How did he unplug?" you ask, intrigued by the concept. Wilkins leans back, a thoughtful expression on his face. "That's the million-credit question, isn't it? Most folks, they just try to avoid the Wires. Roberts... he went deeper. He found the quiet places, the blind spots in their network. He built his own ship, the *Lacuna*, a ghost in the void. It's not just about cutting off the data streams, see. It's about becoming invisible. Becoming silence itself." He looks at you, a hint of admiration in his eyes. "It's a dangerous path, writer. The Wires don't like it when their sheep wander too far from the flock."
