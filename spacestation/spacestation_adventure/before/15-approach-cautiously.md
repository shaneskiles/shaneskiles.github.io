You decide to approach the lone figure cautiously, observing their behavior from a distance. You move slowly, trying to make as little noise as possible. The figure remains still, their back mostly to you, seemingly engrossed in whatever they are examining on the wall. The dimly lit corridor stretches out, and the silence is broken only by the faint hum of the station. You wonder if they are aware of your presence, or if they are truly lost in their own world.
