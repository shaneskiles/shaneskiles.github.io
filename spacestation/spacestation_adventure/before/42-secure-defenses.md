"Securing the area and setting up defenses?" Wilkins nods. "You'd need to seal off any unwanted access points, set up physical barriers, even some rudimentary traps. Warning systems, motion sensors, anything that can alert you to unwanted visitors. And surveillance, old-world cameras, anything that doesn't rely on the Wires' network. It's about protecting your sanctuary, about keeping the Wires and other scavengers out. It's a constant battle, but if you can pull it off, you'd have your own private haven, a place where you can truly be free."
