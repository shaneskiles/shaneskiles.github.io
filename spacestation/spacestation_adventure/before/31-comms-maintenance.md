"Regular maintenance and component replacement for old comms?" Wilkins sighs. "It's a constant battle against entropy. Dust, corrosion, wear and tear. You need to clean the contacts, lubricate the moving parts, replace worn-out vacuum tubes or capacitors. And sourcing replacement components can be a nightmare. Most of them aren't manufactured anymore. You have to scavenge them, or trade for them on the black market. It's a lot of work, and it's never perfect. But every clear transmission, every uninterrupted conversation, is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
