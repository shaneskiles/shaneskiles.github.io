You attempt to activate the viewport's functions, pressing and tapping on various sections of the seamless plasteel. Nothing happens. It remains a silent, unmoving window to the void. You try to imagine what kind of interface Roberts might use, if this is indeed his observatory. Perhaps it's voice-activated, or requires a specific biometric key. The lack of response is frustrating, but also intriguing. It suggests a level of sophistication beyond your current understanding.
