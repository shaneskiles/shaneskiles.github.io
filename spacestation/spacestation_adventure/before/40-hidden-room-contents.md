"The typical contents of hidden rooms?" Wilkins shrugs. "It varies. Sometimes it's just a dusty old storage space, filled with forgotten junk. Other times, you might find stashes of non-perishable food, water, old-world batteries, even analog comms gear. Personal effects, old datapads, diaries... things people wanted to keep hidden from the Wires. Sometimes, you might even find a small, makeshift living space, a temporary refuge for someone trying to go off-grid. It's a glimpse into the lives of those who defied the system, a testament to their stubbornness."
