"Their current whereabouts or status?" Wilkins shakes his head. "They disappeared. Some say they went deep into the void, seeking places where the Wires couldn't reach. Others say they found refuge in fringe habitats, among others who reject the network. But they're not part of society anymore. They can't interact with the Wires' systems, can't use their tech. They're ghosts in the machine, living on the fringes. Whatever the truth, the Wires don't want anyone looking too closely. They want that medbay forgotten."
