"The longest recorded crackdown?" Wilkins shivers slightly. "There was one, years ago, on a small independent station called 'Haven'. Someone there managed to disrupt a major Wire data hub, a real blow to their network. The Wires responded with a full-scale lockdown that lasted for three months. No comms in or out, no supply ships, constant drone patrols. They starved them out, writer. Made an example of them. It was a grim reminder of what happens when you truly defy the Wires. Most of the inhabitants either surrendered, or... well, they just disappeared. Haven is a ghost station now."
