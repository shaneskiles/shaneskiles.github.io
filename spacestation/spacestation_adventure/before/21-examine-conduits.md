You carefully examine the main conduits of the life support system in the Hydroponics Level. They are a complex network of pipes and wires, some exposed, others encased in rusted plating. You look for any signs of corrosion, wear, or damage that could compromise the system. The hum of the life support is more pronounced here, a constant reminder of its vital role. You wonder if the Wires, or anyone else, might exploit such weaknesses.
