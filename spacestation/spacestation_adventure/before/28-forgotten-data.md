Information the Wires deemed irrelevant, or dangerous. It's usually stored on old, unencrypted drives, or even physical data chips. But accessing it is another matter. Most of the old systems are dead, or require specialized knowledge to reactivate. And even if you get it, who knows what you'll find? The truth can be a heavy burden, writer."
