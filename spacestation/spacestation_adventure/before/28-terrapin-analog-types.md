"Types of analog tech found on Terrapin?" Wilkins shrugs. "Mostly comms units, old manual control panels, sometimes even a rudimentary navigation system. Nothing fancy, mind you. These are the relics of a bygone era, before the Wires took over everything. They're usually in rough shape, requiring a lot of work to get them operational. But they're pure. No digital interference, no Wire backdoors. They're a direct link to the past, and a potential lifeline for the future."
