"Using asteroid gravity for slingshot maneuvers?" Wilkins nods. "It's an advanced technique, but incredibly effective. You use the gravitational pull of a large asteroid to accelerate your ship, to gain massive speed without expending fuel. It's all about precision, about timing, about trusting your instincts. One wrong move, and you could be flung into the void, or crushed by the asteroid's gravity. But if you master it, you can go where the Wires can't follow, and where no automated system would dare."
