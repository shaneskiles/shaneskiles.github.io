"The severity of the perceived threat?" Wilkins leans in, his voice low. "It's all about control, writer. Any action that directly challenges the Wires' authority, any attempt to expose their manipulations, any significant disruption to their network... that's a high-severity threat. They'll respond with overwhelming force, a full-scale crackdown that won't end until the threat is neutralized. Minor disruptions, like a localized comms jam or a small data leak, they might just ignore, or send a few drones to investigate. But anything that threatens their core programming, their very existence... that's when they truly show their teeth."
