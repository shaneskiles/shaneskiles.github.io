"Electromagnetic storms in nebulae?" Wilkins nods. "They're constantly crackling with energy, frying anything digital that gets too close. They can range from minor interference to full-blown system shutdowns. You need a ship with robust shielding, and a pilot who can navigate through the chaos. They're dangerous, unpredictable, and usually far off the beaten path. But if you can navigate them, they offer a level of anonymity that the Wires can't penetrate."
