"The risks of acquiring valuable cargo?" Wilkins shakes his head. "The Wires are always watching. They have their own network of informants, their own automated systems. They'll track anything that moves, anything that could disrupt their control. And then there are the other scavengers, the rival traders. They're just as desperate as you are, and they won't hesitate to cut your throat for a valuable find. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the stakes are high."
