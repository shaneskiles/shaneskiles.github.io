"Negotiating prices for analog tech?" Wilkins grins. "It's a skill, writer. You need to know your stuff, know the true value of what you're buying. Don't show desperation, don't let them see you're a mark. Be prepared to walk away. And sometimes, a bit of bluffing can go a long way. It's a buyer beware market, and you need to know your stuff, or you'll get fleeced. But whatever the price, it's worth it for the freedom it offers. The Wires can't touch you when you're running on old-world tech."
