"I can offer my datapad," you say, holding it up. "Perhaps I can look up some schematics, or run a diagnostic on the conduit?" The young mechanic's eyes widen slightly. "A datapad? Most of the ones out here are ancient, barely functional. Yours looks... new. You think it could actually help? This old tech doesn't always play nice with modern diagnostics."
