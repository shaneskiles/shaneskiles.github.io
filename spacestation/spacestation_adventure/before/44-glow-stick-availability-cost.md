"Their availability and cost?" Wilkins nods. "They're cheap, and you can find them almost anywhere. Most independent traders carry them, and even some of the station vendors have a few stashed away. They're not regulated by the Wires, so there's no digital footprint. You can buy them in bulk, or trade for them with other scavengers. They're a basic necessity for anyone trying to go off-grid, a simple tool for staying hidden. But don't expect them to solve all your problems. They're just a temporary light in the darkness."
