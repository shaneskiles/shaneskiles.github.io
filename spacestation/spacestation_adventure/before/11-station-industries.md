"Industries? Activities?" Wilkins chuckles, a dry, humorless sound. "Everything, and nothing, now. Back then, it was a free-for-all. Miners bringing in raw ore from the Belt, independent manufacturers crafting bespoke tech, even a few artists trying to capture the void on canvas. It was a melting pot of independent spirits, all trying to make a living outside the corporate thumb. Now..." He gestures around his shop. "Now it's just salvage and scraps. And the occasional desperate soul looking for a way out."
