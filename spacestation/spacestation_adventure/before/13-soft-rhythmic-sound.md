You decide to make a soft, rhythmic sound, hoping to signal your presence without being too intrusive. You tap your finger gently against your datapad, creating a faint, repeating click. The sound echoes in the profound silence of the observation deck, a small, deliberate ripple in the quiet. You listen intently for any response, any subtle shift in the atmosphere, any sign that your signal has been received. The tension in the room is palpable, as if the very air is holding its breath.
