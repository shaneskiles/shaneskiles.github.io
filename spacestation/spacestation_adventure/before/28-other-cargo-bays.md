"Other cargo bays?" Wilkins gestures vaguely towards the station's interior. "Most of them are active, heavily monitored by the Wires. Legitimate trade, official shipments, all that. You wouldn't want to be caught poking around in there without authorization. Then there are the completely sealed-off bays. No one knows what's in them, or why they were sealed. Some say dangerous experiments, others say forgotten treasures. But they're locked down tight, and the Wires keep a close eye on them. Best to stick to Bay 7 if you're looking for privacy."
