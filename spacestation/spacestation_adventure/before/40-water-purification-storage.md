"Water purification and storage?" Wilkins nods. "The station's recycling system might be throttled, or even shut down during a crackdown. You need your own supply, and a way to purify it. Old-world filters, chemical treatments, even boiling if you have a heat source. And storage. Sealed containers, anything that won't leak or contaminate. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
