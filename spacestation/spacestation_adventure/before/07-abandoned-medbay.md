You search for the Abandoned Medbay, following faint, outdated schematics on your datapad. After a considerable amount of wandering through increasingly desolate corridors, you find a heavily sealed hatch, its warning lights long dead. A faded sign above it reads 'MEDBAY - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY'. The air here is stagnant, and a faint, metallic tang hangs heavy. It's clear this section has been untouched for decades, a forgotten relic of the station's past.
