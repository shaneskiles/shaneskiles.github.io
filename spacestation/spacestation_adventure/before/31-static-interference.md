"Dealing with static and interference in old comms?" Wilkins sighs. "The Wires' chatter is everywhere, and it can easily disrupt a fragile analog signal. You need to know how to filter out the noise, how to find the signal in the static. It's a constant battle against the electromagnetic noise of the station. It's a lot of work, and it's never perfect. But every clear transmission, every uninterrupted conversation, is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
