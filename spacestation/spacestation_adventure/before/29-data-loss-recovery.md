"Data loss and recovery?" Wilkins sighs. "It's usually a complete wipe. The EMP scrambles the circuits, corrupts the data, sometimes even physically burns out components. Your datapad becomes a brick, your comms unit a paperweight. Data recovery is almost impossible, unless you have a shielded backup. It's a harsh lesson, writer. When you use an EMP, you're not just disrupting the Wires; you're disrupting everything digital around you. It's a sacrifice, a necessary one if you want to go truly dark, but a sacrifice nonetheless."
