You call out Roberts's name softly into the darkness of the observation deck. "Roberts? Are you here?" Your voice echoes unnervingly in the profound silence, then dissipates, leaving only the hum of the station. You strain your ears, listening for any response, any subtle shift in the atmosphere. The silence that follows is heavy, making you wonder if you're truly alone, or if someone is listening, choosing not to respond. The name feels strange on your tongue, a whisper in a world of quiet.
