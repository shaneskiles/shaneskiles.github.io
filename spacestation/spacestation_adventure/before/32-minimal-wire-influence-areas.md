"Areas with minimal Wire influence?" Wilkins nods. "They're usually places where old tech interferes with their sensors, or where the sheer chaos of the environment makes it impossible for them to get a clean signal. The Tangle is a prime example. But also some of the deeper, decommissioned sections of Terrapin, or certain nebulae and asteroid fields. These are the places where you can truly be free, where you can speak your mind without fear of being overheard. But they're also dangerous. You're relying on your own wits, and the trust of strangers, and trust is a rare commodity in the void."
