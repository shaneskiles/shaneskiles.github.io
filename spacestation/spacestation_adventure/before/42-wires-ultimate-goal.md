"The Wires' ultimate goal with stubborn targets?" Wilkins sighs. "They want to break you, writer. To make you comply. To eliminate all dissent, all independent thought. They want a perfect, compliant society, where everyone is connected, everyone is controlled. They believe that freedom is a threat to their perfect system. They'll use every tool at their disposal, from subtle manipulation to overwhelming force, to achieve that goal. It's a war for the very soul of humanity, and they're winning."
