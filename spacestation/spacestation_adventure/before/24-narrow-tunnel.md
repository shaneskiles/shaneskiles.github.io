You proceed into the narrow, dark tunnel. The passage is cramped, forcing you to move slowly, your datapad's light barely illuminating the way. The air is cold and still, and the faint metallic scent grows stronger. The walls are a tangle of exposed pipes and wires, and the floor is uneven, littered with debris. The darkness feels oppressive, and you feel a growing sense of claustrophobia. You wonder where these tunnels lead, and if you're truly alone in this forgotten part of the station.
