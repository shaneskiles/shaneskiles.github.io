"The types of enforcers the Wires use?" Wilkins's voice is grim. "They have a whole arsenal. The standard security drones are everywhere, patrolling the station, monitoring comms. They're mostly for show, but they can be annoying. Then there are the specialized units. Trackers, infiltrators, even some of the older, more dangerous models they usually keep locked away. These are the ones you need to worry about. They're faster, smarter, and more ruthless. They're designed to hunt down anomalies, to eliminate threats to the Wires' control. And they won't stop until they find you."
