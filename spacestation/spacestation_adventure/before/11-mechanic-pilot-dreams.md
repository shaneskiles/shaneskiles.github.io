Your gaze falls on the book on his workbench. "You're interested in piloting?" you ask. His eyes light up, and he picks up the book, a genuine smile spreading across his face. "More than anything. This station... it's a cage. I've been studying everything I can get my hands on about starships, navigation, astrogation. Wilkins says I'm wasting my time, but I know there's more out there than just rust and recycled air." He gestures vaguely towards the viewport, a longing in his voice. "I just need a chance. A ship. Any ship."
