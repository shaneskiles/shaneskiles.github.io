You eventually locate Decommissioned Cargo Bay 7, a vast, mostly empty space at the station's most remote point. The magnetic clamps on the floor are rusted, and the old loading equipment stands silent and still, covered in a thick layer of dust. The bay is dimly lit by emergency lights, casting long, distorted shadows. The air is cold and still, carrying the faint scent of old lubricants and something else... something metallic and faintly acrid. This place feels like it holds secrets, a forgotten corner where things might have happened, or still do.
