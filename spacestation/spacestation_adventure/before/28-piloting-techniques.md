"Piloting techniques for asteroid fields?" Wilkins grins, a rare, genuine smile. "It's an art form. You don't just fly through them; you dance with them. Using the asteroids themselves as cover, for instance. Ducking behind a large rock to break a sensor lock, or using its gravity to slingshot yourself into a new trajectory. And reading the currents. Asteroid fields aren't static; they have their own internal movements, their own flows. A good pilot can feel them, anticipate them, and use them to their advantage. It's all about instinct, about trusting your gut, not some Wire-controlled navigation system."
