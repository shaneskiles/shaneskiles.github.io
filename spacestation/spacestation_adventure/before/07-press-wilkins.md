"Why him?" Wilkins repeats your question, his gaze unwavering. "Because he's different. He came here with a purpose. He wasn't running from the worlds, he was running *to* the silence." He gestures vaguely towards the void outside. "Most of us end up here because there's nowhere else to go. Roberts... he's different. He truly unplugged. Not just from the data streams, but from the Wires themselves." He leans in conspiratorially. "And they are always listening. So we try not to give them anything worth hearing." He waits, a silent challenge in his eyes, to see how you'll react to this revelation.
