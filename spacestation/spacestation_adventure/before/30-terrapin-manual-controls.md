"Manual control panels or navigation systems on Terrapin?" Wilkins nods. "You might find them in old maintenance tunnels, or salvaged from decommissioned sections. They're usually basic, mechanical interfaces. Levers, dials, physical buttons. Nothing digital, nothing the Wires can touch. They're designed for direct control, for a pilot who trusts their own hands over an algorithm. They're rare, and often in need of repair, but they offer a level of control and security that modern systems can't match. It's a dying art, operating these things, but a vital one."
