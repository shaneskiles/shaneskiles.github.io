"Essential supplies for a lockdown?" Wilkins ticks them off on his fingers. "Non-perishable food, enough water to last, and a reliable power source that doesn't rely on the station's grid. Old-world batteries, hand-crank generators, anything analog. And light. Plenty of light. The Wires will cut the power, plunge you into darkness. You need to be self-sufficient, to rely on your own resources. It's about preparing for the worst, about being ready to go completely dark. It's a hard life, but a free one."
