"The level of Wire monitoring in active bays?" Wilkins says, a hint of disdain in his voice. "Constant. Every shipment logged, every movement tracked. High-resolution cameras, motion sensors, biometric scanners. You wouldn't want to be caught poking around in there without authorization. The Wires have a complete picture of everything that happens in those bays. It's efficient, yes, but it's also a cage. No room for secrets, no room for freedom. It's their domain, and they enforce their rules with extreme prejudice."
