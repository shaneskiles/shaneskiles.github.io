"The original purpose of the Silent Watch?" Wilkins says, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Some say it was a pre-Collapse listening post, designed to monitor deep space anomalies, to search for signs of intelligent life. Others say it was a Wire research facility, where they conducted their most forbidden experiments, trying to understand the nature of consciousness, of freedom. Whatever its original purpose, it's silent now. No Wire chatter, no active systems. But some believe it still holds secrets, data that could expose the Wires' true nature. It's a dangerous place, writer. And the silence can be deafening."
