"The psychological tactics used against stubborn targets?" Wilkins chuckles, a grim sound. "They'll cut off your supplies, isolate you, spread rumors about you. They'll try to turn your friends against you, to make you feel alone and desperate. They'll use their network to manipulate your reputation, to make you an outcast. It's a war of wills, writer. They want to break your spirit, to make you believe that resistance is futile. They have infinite patience, and they'll keep the pressure on until you break, or until you make a mistake."
