"The motivations of those who entered the medbay after it was sealed?" Wilkins shakes his head. "Fools, mostly. Scavengers looking for forgotten tech, thrill-seekers looking for a scare, or even desperate souls hoping for a cure. They thought they could outsmart the Wires, outsmart whatever was in there. They were driven by greed, by curiosity, by desperation. But none of them ever came back the same. Some disappeared entirely. Others returned... changed. Mumbling about voices, about the Wires, about things they shouldn't have seen. The medbay has a way of getting inside your head, writer. Best to leave it alone."
