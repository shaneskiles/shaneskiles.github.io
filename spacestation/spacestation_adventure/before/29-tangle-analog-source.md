"The Tangle as a source for analog tech?" Wilkins nods. "It's a hub for all sorts of independent traders and scavengers, and they deal in old-world tech. You'll find everything from pre-Collapse comms arrays to ancient mechanical computers. They value that kind of independence, that freedom from the Wires' control. It's not always in pristine condition, but it's usually functional, or can be made so with a bit of work. And the best part? No Wire can track it, no algorithm can control it. It's pure freedom, if you can get your hands on it."
