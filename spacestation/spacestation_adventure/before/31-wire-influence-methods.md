"The methods the Wires use to exert influence?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're subtle, insidious. They send their probes, their informants, their digital chatter. They try to infiltrate local networks, to spread their propaganda, to sow discord. They monitor comms, track movements, analyze behavior. They try to make you believe that their way is the only way, that resistance is futile. But these habitats are designed to resist. They have their own networks, their own ways of communicating, their own defenses. It's a constant struggle, but they've managed to maintain their independence."
