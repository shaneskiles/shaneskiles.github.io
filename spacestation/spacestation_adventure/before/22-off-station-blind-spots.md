"Off-station blind spots are a different beast," Wilkins explains, leaning forward conspiratorially. "Think big. Dense nebulae, asteroid fields, even the gravitational anomalies around certain gas giants. The Wires' signals get scattered, distorted, or just plain swallowed up. And then there are the fringe habitats, like the Tangle. Built by independent groups, often with older, less integrated tech. They're not exactly 'blind spots' in the traditional sense, but they're certainly less... monitored. The Wires don't like places they can't fully control."
