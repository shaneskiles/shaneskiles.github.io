"The psychological toll of unpredictability?" Wilkins sighs, a weary look in his eyes. "Never knowing when the next crackdown will hit, when they'll cut off your supplies, when they'll come for you. It wears you down, makes you desperate. You can't plan, you can't prepare. Every shadow seems to hide a drone, every comms static seems to carry a threat. It's a constant state of anxiety, a slow erosion of your sanity. It's a psychological game as much as a physical one. And they're very, very good at it. They want to break your spirit, to make you believe that resistance is futile."
