You decide to leave the observation deck for now, planning to return later. The silence and the endless waiting are starting to get to you. You need a change of scenery, a new lead. You make a mental note of the path back to the observation deck, hoping that a fresh perspective, or a different time of day, might yield better results. The station is vast, and there are many other places to explore, many other secrets to uncover.
