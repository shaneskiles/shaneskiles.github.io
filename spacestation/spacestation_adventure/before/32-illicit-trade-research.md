"Illicit trade or specialized research in these habitats?" Wilkins nods. "Anything that doesn't pass through official channels. Unsanctioned tech, forbidden data, rare minerals. And specialized research, things the Wires wouldn't approve of. New technologies, forbidden data, even attempts to understand the Wires themselves. It's a dangerous life, but a profitable one for those who are willing to take the risks. But it also draws unwanted attention, from the Wires, and from other desperate individuals."
