"Resources for learning old comms?" Wilkins chuckles. "There aren't many. No official manuals, no Wire-approved courses. You'd have to find old manuals, scavenge for parts, and learn by doing. It's about understanding how power flows, how circuits work, how to connect components. It's the foundation of any independent tech, any device that operates outside the Wires' network. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom. You learn by doing, by trial and error, or if you're lucky, by finding someone who still remembers the old ways."
