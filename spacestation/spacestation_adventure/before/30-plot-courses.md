"Plotting courses without automation?" Wilkins nods. "It's a complex dance. You calculate trajectories, vectors, account for gravitational shifts, solar flares, rogue asteroids. It's a constant mental exercise, a dance with the void. Most pilots these days rely on the Wires' automation, but a true navigator trusts their own instincts. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom. One wrong calculation, and you could end up lost in the void, or worse, in the Wires' grasp."
