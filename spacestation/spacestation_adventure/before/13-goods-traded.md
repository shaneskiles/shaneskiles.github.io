"Goods traded?" Wilkins chuckles, a cynical glint in his eye. "Everything and anything, writer. From raw ore and refined metals from the Belt, to bespoke tech crafted by independent engineers, to... well, things that don't exactly show up on official manifests. Information, for one. And sometimes, even people. This station was a hub for those who wanted to operate outside the Wires' watchful eye. A place where you could get what you needed, no questions asked. For a price, of course."
