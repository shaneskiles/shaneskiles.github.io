"The cost of off-station analog tech?" Wilkins sighs. "It's not cheap, writer. These are rare items, and those who have them know their value. You're looking at a significant amount of credits, or a trade of equal value. Sometimes, you can offer services instead. Piloting, scavenging, even just information. The fringe habitats operate on their own economy, and credits aren't always king. But whatever the price, it's worth it for the freedom it offers. The Wires can't touch you when you're running on old-world tech."
