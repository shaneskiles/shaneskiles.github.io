"The active cargo bays," Wilkins says, a hint of disdain in his voice. "They're under constant surveillance by the Wires. Every shipment logged, every movement tracked. You wouldn't want to be caught poking around in there without authorization. They handle all the legitimate trade, the official shipments, the things that keep the station running. Food, water, raw materials, manufactured goods. All accounted for, all controlled. It's efficient, yes, but it's also a cage. No room for secrets, no room for freedom."
