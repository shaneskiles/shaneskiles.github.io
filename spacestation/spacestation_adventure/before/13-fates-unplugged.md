"Their fates?" Wilkins's voice is low, almost a whisper. "Some just... disappear. Their comms go silent, their ships vanish. Others, they come back, but they're not the same. Eyes vacant, muttering nonsense about the Wires. They become warnings, you see. Living examples of what happens when you try to step outside the system. The Wires are subtle, but they're thorough. They don't need to kill you to break you." He shivers slightly, despite the station's regulated temperature.
