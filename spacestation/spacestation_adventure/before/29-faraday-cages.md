"Faraday cages or shielding?" Wilkins nods. "They can help, but they're not foolproof. A shielded box that blocks electromagnetic fields. But it has to be perfect, no gaps, no weak points. And even then, a strong enough pulse can still get through. It's a trade-off, writer. You either risk your tech, or you go dark. There's no foolproof way to protect everything when you're playing with that kind of power. But a well-built Faraday cage can give you a fighting chance, a moment of silence from the Wires."
