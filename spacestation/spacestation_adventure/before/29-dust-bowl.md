"The Dust Bowl," Wilkins says, a grimace on his face. "It's a rough place, out in the outer rim. A mining colony, mostly. Full of independent miners who don't care for the Wires' regulations. The living conditions are harsh, the air is thick with dust, and the work is back-breaking. But they're free. No Wire chatter, no constant surveillance. They mine rare minerals, things the Wires need but can't easily control. It's a hard life, but a free one. Just don't expect any luxuries out there. And be prepared to get your hands dirty."
