"Roberts's methods?" Wilkins leans in, his voice dropping to a near whisper. "He's a ghost, writer. He doesn't just block signals; he *becomes* silence. He found the gaps in the Wires' network, the places they don't bother to monitor, or can't. And his ship, the *Lacuna*... it's not like anything I've ever worked on. Seamless, matte-black, drinks the light. It's designed to be invisible, to slip through the cracks. He built it himself, piece by piece, out of salvaged tech and pure stubbornness. It's his sanctuary, and his weapon."
