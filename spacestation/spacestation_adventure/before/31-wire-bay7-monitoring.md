"Wire monitoring in Bay 7?" Wilkins chuckles. "It's more of a suggestion than a rule. The Wires don't bother with it much, too much old tech interfering with their sensors. You might see a stray security drone now and then, but they're easily avoided. They report everything back to the central network, but the data is often incomplete, or corrupted. It's a blind spot, a place where the Wires' grip is weakest. But they're always trying to extend their reach, always trying to find a way in. So you still have to be careful."
