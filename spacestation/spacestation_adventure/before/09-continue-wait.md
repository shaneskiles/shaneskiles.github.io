You continue to wait in the profound silence of the observation deck. Minutes stretch into what feels like hours. The stars remain a silent, glittering tapestry. The hum of the station is a constant, almost hypnotic drone. You find yourself drifting, your thoughts becoming as vast and empty as the void outside. No one appears. No hidden mechanisms activate. Just the endless, quiet expanse. You begin to wonder if Roberts will ever come, or if this is simply a place he visits, not inhabits.
