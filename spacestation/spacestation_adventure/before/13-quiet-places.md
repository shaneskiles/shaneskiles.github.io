"Quiet places, blind spots..." Wilkins muses, looking out into the cluttered shop. "They're not on any map, writer. They're the forgotten corners, the areas the Wires deemed irrelevant, or too much trouble to monitor. Old maintenance tunnels, decommissioned cargo bays, even some of the older, unmaintained residential blocks. Places where the data streams are thin, where the Wires' eyes don't reach. Roberts found 'em. He knows how to move through 'em like a ghost. That's his secret."
