"Scavenging for analog tech components?" Wilkins nods. "The decommissioned sections of the station, the forgotten wrecks in asteroid fields. It's a long shot, and often dangerous, but you might find what you need. Old comms units, manual control panels, even raw materials that can be repurposed. It's all about being resourceful, about thinking outside the Wires' network. That's how we survive out here. But be careful. You're not the only one looking for these things, and some scavengers don't play nice."
