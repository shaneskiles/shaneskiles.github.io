"The difficulty of operating old comms?" Wilkins chuckles. "It's not like tapping a datapad, writer. You need to understand frequencies, modulation, signal strength. You need to have a feel for the static, to know when it's just interference and when it's a message trying to break through. It's a skill, a craft. Most people these days wouldn't know where to begin. But if you master it, you can communicate in ways the Wires can't even comprehend. It's a powerful tool, but only in the right hands."
