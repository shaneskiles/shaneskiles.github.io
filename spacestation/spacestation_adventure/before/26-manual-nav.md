"Manual navigation," Wilkins says, a nostalgic look in his eyes. "It's a lost art, almost. No digital maps, no automated course corrections. Just you, a star chart, a sextant, and your own two eyes. You plot your course by the stars, by the known gravitational anomalies, by the faint whispers of old beacon signals. It's slow, it's tedious, and it's prone to error if you're not careful. But it's also the only way to truly go off-grid. The Wires can't track what they can't see, and they can't see a ship that's navigating by the light of distant suns."
