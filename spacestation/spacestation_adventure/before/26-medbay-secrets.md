"Secrets in the medbay?" Wilkins looks around nervously, as if the Wires might be listening. "They say there are hidden passages, maintenance tunnels that lead to other sealed-off sections of the station. Places the Wires don't even know about. And old data logs, forgotten equipment. Who knows what you might find in there? Cures for diseases, blueprints for forbidden tech, or even evidence of what *really* happened. But getting in is one thing. Getting out, and getting out with your sanity intact, is another. The medbay has a way of... changing people."
