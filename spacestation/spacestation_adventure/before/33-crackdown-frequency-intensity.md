"The frequency and intensity of Wire crackdowns?" Wilkins sighs, a weary look in his eyes. "They're unpredictable, writer. Sometimes it's a subtle tightening of the network, a few extra drones patrolling, a slight delay in comms. Other times, it's a full-blown lockdown. They can happen once a cycle, or not for years. It usually depends on how much noise someone's been making, how much they've disrupted the Wires' control. And the intensity... it can range from a minor inconvenience to a complete shutdown of all non-essential systems. They want to make life difficult, to remind you who's in charge. They want to squeeze you until you break, or until you comply."
