"Nebulae and asteroid fields," Wilkins says, a wistful look in his eyes. "They're the wild west of space. The Wires hate them. Too much dust, too many rocks, too much raw energy messing with their signals. The 'Veil Nebula' is a classic, a real mess of gas and dust that swallows up anything digital. And asteroid fields... well, they're just chaos. Every rock a potential shield, every collision a burst of interference. But they're dangerous. One wrong move, and you're just another piece of space junk. You need a good pilot, and a ship that can handle the rough ride."
