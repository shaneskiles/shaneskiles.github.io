You carefully scan the floor and ledges near the viewport for any discarded items or personal effects. The area is mostly clean, but you notice a faint scorch mark on the floor near the center of the room, almost imperceptible against the dark metal. There are no obvious personal items, no datapads or tools left behind. It's as if anyone who comes here leaves no trace, or perhaps, is very careful not to.
