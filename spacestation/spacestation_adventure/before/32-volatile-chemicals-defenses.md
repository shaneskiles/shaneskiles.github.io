"Volatile chemicals or automated defenses?" Wilkins shakes his head. "These are the things that can get you killed, or worse, get you noticed by the Wires. Unstable power cells, corrosive acids, even biological agents. And dormant automated defenses, old security systems that are still active, waiting for a trigger. They're usually found in the deeper, unmonitored sections, or smuggled in by desperate individuals. They're dangerous, unpredictable, and highly illegal. And the Wires don't like anything that disrupts their control, and these are a direct challenge to their authority."
