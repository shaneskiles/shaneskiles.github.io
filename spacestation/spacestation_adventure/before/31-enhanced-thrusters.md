"Enhanced thrusters?" Wilkins nods. "You need to be able to change direction on a dime, dodge incoming rocks. High-thrust vectoring, rapid-response nozzles, even some experimental magnetic drives. It's expensive, and it adds weight, but it's the difference between surviving an asteroid field and becoming part of it. And even with all that, you still need a pilot who knows what they're doing. These aren't for joyrides, writer. These are for survival."
