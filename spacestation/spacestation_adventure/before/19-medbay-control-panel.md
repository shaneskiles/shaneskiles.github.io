You search for a control panel or override mechanism near the Medbay door. You find a small, rusted panel embedded in the wall, its indicator lights dark. It looks ancient, and you wonder if it's still functional. You run your fingers over the buttons and interfaces, looking for any sign of life. The air here is stagnant, and the silence is broken only by your own breathing. You hope this panel holds the key to opening the sealed door.
