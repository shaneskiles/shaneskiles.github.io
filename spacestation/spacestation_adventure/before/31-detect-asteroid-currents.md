"Detecting asteroid field currents?" Wilkins nods. "It's not something you learn from a datapad. It's about intuition, about a deep understanding of the void. You feel the subtle shifts in gravity, the faint whispers of displaced dust, the almost imperceptible hum of colliding rocks. It's a sixth sense, developed over years of flying blind. A good pilot can feel them, anticipate them, and use them to their advantage. It's all about instinct, about trusting your gut, not some Wire-controlled navigation system."
