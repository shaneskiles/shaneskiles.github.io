"Acquiring an EMP device..." Wilkins shakes his head slowly. "You don't just pick those up at the corner store, writer. They're highly illegal, highly regulated. Your best bet is to build one yourself, if you have the technical know-how and the components. Or, if you're desperate, you might find one on the black market, but you'd be dealing with some very unsavory characters. And the Wires are always watching those channels. It's a dangerous game, playing with that kind of fire."
