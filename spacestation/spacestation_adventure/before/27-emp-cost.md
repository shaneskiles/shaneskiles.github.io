"The cost of an EMP device?" Wilkins scoffs. "More than you can imagine, writer. We're talking about a small fortune in credits, or a trade of something equally valuable. These aren't mass-produced items; they're custom-made, highly illegal, and incredibly dangerous. The sellers know their worth, and they'll squeeze every last credit out of you. And even if you have the money, finding a reliable seller is another challenge. Most of them are con artists, or worse. It's a desperate measure, and usually a very expensive one."
