"Hidden areas or safe zones within the Tangle?" Wilkins nods. "They exist, but they're not marked on any map. You find them by reputation, by word of mouth. Hidden markets, secret docks, places where independent traders gather. And areas where the Wires' influence is completely absent, where old tech interferes with their sensors. These are the places where you can truly be free, where you can speak your mind without fear of being overheard. But they're also dangerous. You're relying on the trust of strangers, and trust is a rare commodity in the Tangle."
