You manage to find the Hydroponics Level, a humid, overgrown section of the station. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation. Most of the grow lights are dark, casting long, eerie shadows. Withered vines and strange, mutated plants cling to the walls and ceiling, a testament to failed attempts at self-sufficiency. Parts of this level are completely unmaintained and very dark, the silence broken only by the drip of water and the rustle of unseen things.
