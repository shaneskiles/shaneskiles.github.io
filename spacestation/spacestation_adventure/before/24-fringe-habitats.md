"Fringe habitats," Wilkins says, a slight smile playing on his lips. "They're the places where the Wires' grip is weakest. The Tangle, for example. It's a sprawling, chaotic mess of salvaged ships and repurposed modules, all lashed together. No central authority, no unified network. Everyone runs their own systems, often old and patched-together tech. It's a haven for those who want to stay off the grid. But it's also dangerous. No rules, no oversight. You're on your own out there. And the Wires still send their probes, trying to map it, trying to find a way in."
