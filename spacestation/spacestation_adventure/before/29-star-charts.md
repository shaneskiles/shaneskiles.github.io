"Star charts?" Wilkins gestures to a rolled-up parchment on his desk. "Not the digital kind, mind you. These are physical maps of the constellations, the nebulae, the known gravitational anomalies. They're old, some of them centuries old, but they're true. No Wire can manipulate them, no algorithm can distort them. They're a direct link to the cosmos, to the raw, unfiltered truth of space. But they require a skilled hand to read, and a keen eye to interpret. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
