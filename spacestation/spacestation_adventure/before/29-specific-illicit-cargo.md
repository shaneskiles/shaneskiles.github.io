"Specific illicit cargo?" Wilkins leans in, his voice a low murmur. "Unsanctioned tech, for one. Anything that operates outside the Wires' network, anything that gives you an edge. Forbidden data, information the Wires have suppressed. Then there are the more dangerous things: volatile chemicals, unstable power cells, even dormant automated defenses. These are the things that can get you killed, or worse, get you noticed by the Wires. They don't like anything that disrupts their control, and illicit cargo is a direct challenge to their authority."
