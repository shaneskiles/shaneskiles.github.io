"The impact of social isolation?" Wilkins sighs, a weary look in his eyes. "They cut you off, writer. They isolate you from your friends, your family, your support network. They spread false information, sow discord, turn people against each other. You become a pariah, an outcast. It's a psychological game as much as a physical one. They want to break your spirit, to make you believe that resistance is futile. They want you to feel utterly alone, utterly helpless. And it's very, very effective."
