"Subtle clues or indicators for hidden rooms?" Wilkins grins. "You look for inconsistencies in the architecture, faint seams in the bulkheads, subtle changes in temperature or air pressure. You listen for hollow sounds when you tap on walls. Sometimes, you'll find old, forgotten maintenance access points that lead to nowhere on the official schematics. It's about trusting your senses, about noticing what the Wires want you to overlook. They're usually small, cramped, and often uncomfortable, but they offer a level of security that the Wires can't penetrate. A true safe haven, if you can find one."
