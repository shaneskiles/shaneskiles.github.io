"The Wires' response to minor disruptions?" Wilkins shrugs. "They might just ignore it, or send a few drones to investigate. A localized comms jam, a small data leak, a temporary power outage... they see it as static, as noise in the system. They'll try to identify the source, to patch the vulnerability, but they won't deploy a full-scale crackdown unless it escalates. They're efficient, writer. They don't waste resources on minor annoyances. But they remember. And if you keep making noise, they'll eventually come for you."
