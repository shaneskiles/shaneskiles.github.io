"Finding a mentor or teacher for old comms?" Wilkins sighs. "They're rare, writer. Most of the old-timers are gone, or they've gone deep off-grid. But if you can find one, they can teach you more in a day than you'd learn in a year of trial and error. They know the tricks, the shortcuts, the hidden frequencies. But they're wary of outsiders, and they don't trust easily. You'd have to prove yourself, demonstrate your commitment to staying off-grid. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
