"The mental or psychological effects?" Wilkins's voice is low, almost a growl. "They say it was a shattering of the mind. A loss of connection, a void where the Wires' chatter used to be. Some went mad, screaming about voices, about things they shouldn't have seen. Others just... faded. Became empty shells. It was as if their very consciousness was being ripped apart. The Wires sealed it off, declared it a failure. But some say, it wasn't a failure at all. Just a different kind of success."
