"Pre-Collapse tech or suppressed data?" Wilkins leans in, his voice a low murmur. "Things that operate outside the Wires' network, things that give you an edge. Old comms units, manual navigation systems, even rudimentary AI that predates the Wires' dominance. And suppressed data, information the Wires don't want you to see. It could be anything from historical records to blueprints for forbidden technology. It's all valuable, all dangerous. And all worth risking your neck for, if you're brave enough."
