You decide to actively look for other inhabitants, hoping to find someone who might offer information or assistance. You move cautiously through the dimly lit corridors, straining your ears for any sounds of life beyond the station's hum. You occasionally glimpse gaunt, pale faces in the distance, their eyes carrying a distant look, but they quickly disappear into the shadows. Their movements are slow, deliberate, and their glances fleeting and suspicious. It's clear that privacy, or perhaps avoidance, is a way of life here.
