You call out Old Man Hemlock's name softly into the humid, overgrown Hydroponics Level. "Hemlock? Are you here?" Your voice is muffled by the dense vegetation, and the sound seems to be absorbed by the damp air. You strain your ears, listening for any response, any rustle in the plants, any sign of his presence. The silence that follows is heavy, broken only by the drip of water and the rustle of unseen things. You wonder if he's truly here, or if he's just a legend.
