"The reliability of analog tech from the Tangle?" Wilkins sighs. "It's not always in pristine condition, but it's usually functional, or can be made so with a bit of work. You'll find everything from pre-Collapse comms arrays to ancient mechanical computers. They're old, patched-together, and often require a lot of work to get them operational. But they're pure. No digital interference, no Wire backdoors. They're a direct link to the past, and a potential lifeline for the future. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
