"The specific methods of service disruption?" Wilkins grimaces. "They're subtle, insidious. They don't cut them off completely, not usually. That would be too obvious, too much of a direct attack. Instead, they throttle them. Power fluctuations, intermittent comms, reduced air recycling. Just enough to make life difficult, to wear you down, to remind you that they control everything. They want to squeeze you until you break, or until you comply. It's a subtle form of torture, writer. A very effective one."
