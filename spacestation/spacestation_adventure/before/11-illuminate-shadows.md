You use your datapad's light to illuminate the deepest shadows of the observation deck. The beam cuts through the gloom, revealing more of the room's forgotten details: dust-covered equipment, faded warning labels, and the intricate network of pipes and conduits running along the walls. The darkness recedes, but it also reveals the extent of the station's decay. You wonder what secrets these shadows have held for so long, and if your light will reveal something you're not meant to see.
