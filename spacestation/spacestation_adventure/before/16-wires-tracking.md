"How do the Wires track them?" you ask, a chill running down your spine. Wilkins shrugs. "Everything's connected, writer. Every comms burst, every data packet, every energy signature. They build a profile. They know where you've been, where you're going, even what you're thinking, if you're not careful. They don't need physical trackers. They just need data. And they have all of it. Unless you're like Roberts, and you become silence itself."
