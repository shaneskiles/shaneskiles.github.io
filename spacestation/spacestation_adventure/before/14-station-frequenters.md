"Who frequented the station?" Wilkins leans back, a nostalgic look in his eyes. "All sorts. Independent traders, prospectors, even a few artists and philosophers who wanted to escape the noise of the inner colonies. Folks who valued freedom more than comfort. They were a rough bunch, but they were honest. Most of 'em, anyway. They came here to be themselves, to live outside the Wires' control. Now..." He shrugs. "Now it's just us ghosts, and the occasional desperate soul."
