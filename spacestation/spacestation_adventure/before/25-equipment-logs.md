You search for any recent maintenance logs or signs of use on the loading equipment. The console is dark, but you try to access its internal memory, hoping to find any stored data. You run your datapad over the various ports, looking for a data transfer connection. The equipment is old, and you wonder if it even keeps detailed logs. The silence of the bay is profound, and you feel a growing sense of anticipation. Could this equipment hold a clue about Roberts or the *Lacuna*?
