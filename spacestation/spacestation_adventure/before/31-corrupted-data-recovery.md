"The possibility of recovering corrupted data?" Wilkins sighs. "It's almost impossible. The EMP scrambles the circuits, corrupts the data, sometimes even physically burns out components. Your datapad becomes a brick, your comms unit a paperweight. Data recovery is a specialized field, and even the best can only do so much with fried hardware. Unless you have a shielded backup, or off-grid storage, consider your data gone. It's a harsh lesson, writer. When you use an EMP, you're not just disrupting the Wires; you're disrupting everything digital around you."
