"Experience?" the young mechanic chuckles, a hint of bitterness in his voice. "Mostly theoretical. I've worked on plenty of station modules, patched up a few derelict shuttles that Wilkins dragged in. But actually *piloting*? That's a different story. You need permits, licenses, and a ship that isn't held together with duct tape and prayers. Still, I've spent countless hours in simulators, and I know the theory inside and out. I could fly anything, given the chance."
