"The old cargo bays," Wilkins muses, a faraway look in his eyes. "They're a maze of forgotten goods and dead ends. Bay 7, in particular, is a good spot. It's mostly decommissioned, and the Wires don't bother with it much. Too much interference from the old loading equipment, too many nooks and crannies for their sensors to penetrate. You might find anything in there, from ancient Earth artifacts to illicit tech. Just be careful. Some of those old bays have... residents. Things that don't like being disturbed."
