"The living conditions in the Dust Bowl?" Wilkins says, a grimace on his face. "Harsh. The air is thick with dust, the gravity is often unstable, and the work is back-breaking. It's a constant struggle against the environment, against the decay of old tech, and against the Wires' attempts to control them. But they're free. No Wire chatter, no constant surveillance. They mine rare minerals, things the Wires need but can't easily control. It's a hard life, but a free one. Just don't expect any luxuries out there. And be prepared to get your hands dirty."
