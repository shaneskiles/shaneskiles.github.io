"The factors influencing crackdown duration?" Wilkins rubs his chin. "It mostly comes down to two things: the severity of the perceived threat, and how stubborn the target is. If you've just disrupted a major Wire operation, they'll throw everything they have at you, and the crackdown will last until they either catch you or you disappear completely. If you're just a minor annoyance, they might give up after a few days. And if you're stubborn, if you refuse to break, they'll keep the pressure on, hoping you'll eventually make a mistake. It's a war of attrition, writer. And they have infinite resources."
