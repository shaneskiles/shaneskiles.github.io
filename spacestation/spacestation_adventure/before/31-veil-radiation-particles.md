"The specific types of radiation or particles in the Veil Nebula?" Wilkins nods. "It's a chaotic soup of gas, dust, and raw energy. Electromagnetic radiation, exotic particles, even rogue gravitational eddies. They all contribute to the interference, scattering and absorbing signals. The Wires' long-range comms just get lost in it. It's like trying to hear a whisper in a hurricane. It affects all digital signals, scrambling them, distorting them, or just plain swallowing them up. It's a natural shield, a perfect place to disappear. But it's also full of unpredictable energy surges, and pockets of corrosive gas. One wrong move, and your ship could be torn apart, or your systems fried."
