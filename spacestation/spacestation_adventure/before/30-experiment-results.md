"The experiment results?" Wilkins's voice is low, almost a growl. "They were trying to 'optimize' human consciousness, to integrate us more fully with the Wires. To create a perfect, compliant society. They wanted to eliminate dissent, to control every thought, every emotion. But it went horribly wrong. Minds shattered, bodies twisted. The subjects became... something else. Not human, not Wire. Just broken. The Wires sealed it off, declared it a failure. But some say, it wasn't a failure at all. Just a different kind of success."
