"Specific old cargo bays for analog tech?" Wilkins scratches his beard. "Bay 7, for sure. It's mostly decommissioned, and the Wires don't bother with it much. Scavengers sometimes pull old comms units or manual control panels out of there. There are other older bays, deeper in the station, but they're harder to access and often more dangerous. It's rare, and usually in rough shape, but it's out there. You just have to be willing to dig through a lot of junk, and avoid the Wires' patrols."
