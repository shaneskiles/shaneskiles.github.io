"Old-world batteries and their lifespan?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're not efficient, and they don't last forever, but they're secure. Lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, even some ancient chemical cells. They're heavy, bulky, and require careful handling, but no Wire can tap into them, no algorithm can control them. You have to work for your power, but it's *your* power. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
