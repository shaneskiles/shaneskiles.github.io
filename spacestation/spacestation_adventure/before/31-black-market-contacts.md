"The risks of dealing with black market contacts?" Wilkins shakes his head. "You're dealing with the lowest of the low, writer. Scams, traps, double-crosses. Most of the sellers are unreliable, and some are outright dangerous. They'll sell you a faulty device, or a data chip filled with useless information. Or they'll set you up, lead you into a trap, and then rob you blind. You have to be constantly on your guard, trust no one. And even then, it's a gamble. The black market is a cesspool, and you're just another fish in the barrel. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the house always wins."
