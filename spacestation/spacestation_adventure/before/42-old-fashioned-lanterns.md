"Old-fashioned lanterns and their fuel?" Wilkins nods. "Kerosene, bio-diesel, even some repurposed industrial lubricants. They're messy, they smell, and they're a fire hazard if you're not careful. But they're bright, they last, and no Wire can track them. They're perfect for illuminating larger spaces, for setting up a temporary camp, for signaling across a distance. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
