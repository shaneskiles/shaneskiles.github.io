"Reactivating old systems?" Wilkins sighs. "Most of them are dead, or require specialized knowledge to reactivate. You'd need to be a tech-head, someone who understands ancient operating systems and forgotten protocols. Power conduits might be corroded, data lines severed, interfaces incompatible. It's a massive undertaking, and often dangerous. But if you can bring an old system back online, you might gain access to a wealth of information, a direct link to the past, untouched by the Wires."
