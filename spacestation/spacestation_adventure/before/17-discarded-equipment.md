You begin to search for any discarded equipment that might have a power source or could serve as a light. You sift through piles of rusted metal, broken conduits, and unidentifiable debris. The air is thick with dust, and the darkness makes it difficult to see clearly. You spot a few old power cells, their indicators dark, and a broken lamp. You wonder if anything here is still functional, or if it's all just junk.
