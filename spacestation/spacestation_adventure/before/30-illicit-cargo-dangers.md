"The dangers of dealing with illicit cargo?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's a minefield, writer. You're dealing with the kind of people who don't mind breaking the rules, and they don't mind breaking you. Scams, double-crosses, ambushes. And the Wires are always watching. They have their own informants, their own automated systems. They'll let you make your deal, let you think you're safe, and then they'll swoop in. It's a dangerous game, and the stakes are high. One wrong move, and you could end up in a Wire detention center, or worse, floating in the void."
