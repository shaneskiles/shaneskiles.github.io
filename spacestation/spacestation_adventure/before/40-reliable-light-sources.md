"Reliable light sources?" Wilkins nods. "Chemical glow sticks, old-fashioned lanterns, anything that doesn't emit a digital signature. The Wires will cut the power, plunge you into darkness. You need your own light, your own energy. They're not bright, and they don't last forever, but they're secure. No Wire can track them, no algorithm can control them. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
