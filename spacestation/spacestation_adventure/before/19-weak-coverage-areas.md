Wilkins leans back, a thoughtful expression on his face. "Weak coverage areas, huh? Think of it like this: the Wires are everywhere, but some places are just... noisier. Old sections of the station, especially those built before the full integration, tend to have more interference. Or places with heavy electromagnetic fields, like certain cargo bays or the older power conduits. They can't get a clean signal there. Off-station, it's even easier. Deep space, nebulae, asteroid fields â€“ anything that messes with their long-range comms. But you don't just stumble into these places; you have to know where to look, or how to make your own blind spot."
