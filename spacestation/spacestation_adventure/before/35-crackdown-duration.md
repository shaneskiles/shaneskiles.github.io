"The typical duration of a crackdown?" Wilkins shrugs. "It varies. Sometimes it's just a few hours, a quick show of force to remind everyone who's in charge. Other times, it can drag on for days, even weeks, if the Wires are really trying to flush someone out. It depends on the severity of the perceived threat, and how stubborn the target is. They'll keep the pressure on until they get what they want, or until they decide it's not worth the resources. It's a war of attrition, writer. And they have infinite resources."
