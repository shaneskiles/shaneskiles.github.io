"Alternative payment methods for an EMP?" Wilkins nods. "Credits aren't always king on the black market. You can trade goods, services, even information. A rare mineral for an EMP, a piloting job for a device. But it's risky. You're dealing with the lowest of the low, and they'll take advantage of any weakness. And the Wires are always watching those channels. You'd be putting a target on your back the moment you even *thought* about trading for one. It's a desperate move, and usually a fatal one."
