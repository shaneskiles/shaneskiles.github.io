You decide to call out softly to the lone figure in the distance. "Hello?" Your voice echoes unnervingly in the dimly lit corridor. The figure pauses, their movements ceasing. Slowly, they turn their head, and you can feel their gaze on you, even from this distance. Their face is obscured by shadow, but you sense a stillness, a profound quiet about them. You wonder if this is a resident, a fellow traveler, or something else entirely.
