"The risks of EMPs?" Wilkins sighs, running a hand through his thinning hair. "Where do I begin? First, anything digital in the blast radius is toast. Your datapad, your comms, even the station's local systems if you're not careful. It's a blunt instrument. And then there's the Wires' reaction. They don't like being cut off. They'll send their enforcers, their drones, their digital hounds. They'll lock down the area, scan for anomalies, and they won't stop until they find the source. It's a declaration of war, writer. Are you ready for that?"
