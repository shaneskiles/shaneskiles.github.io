You run your hands along the walls in the darker corners of the observation deck, feeling for any hidden panels or passages. The metal is cold and rough, and you can feel the subtle vibrations of the station's machinery. You meticulously trace the seams of the bulkheads, searching for any give, any slight indentation that might indicate a concealed door. The silence is absolute, making you hyper-aware of every subtle texture and temperature change. You wonder if Roberts, or someone else, has left a secret entrance here.
