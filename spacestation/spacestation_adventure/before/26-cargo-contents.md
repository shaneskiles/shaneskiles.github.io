"Cargo contents?" Wilkins grins, a flash of gold tooth. "Anything and everything, writer. From legitimate trade goods to... well, things that aren't so legitimate. Old Earth artifacts, pre-Collapse tech, even data chips filled with information the Wires don't want you to see. Sometimes, you'll find salvaged ship parts, enough to build a small vessel if you're clever. But there's also dangerous stuff: unstable power cells, volatile chemicals, even dormant automated defenses. You never know what you'll stumble upon in those forgotten bays."
