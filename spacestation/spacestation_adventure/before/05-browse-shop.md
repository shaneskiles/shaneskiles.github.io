You decide to browse Wilkins's cluttered shop, hoping to find something useful or a clue about Roberts. Shelves are overflowing with dusty, mismatched components, flickering lights, and strange, unidentifiable gadgets. The air is thick with the smell of old metal and stale coffee. Wilkins watches you with a wary eye, but doesn't interfere. You notice a small, locked display case near the counter, and a faint, almost imperceptible hum coming from a stack of old, deactivated comms equipment.
