"How to gain the trust of Tangle inhabitants?" Wilkins shrugs. "It's not easy. They're wary of outsiders, and they don't trust easily. You have to prove yourself. Demonstrate your usefulness, your loyalty, your commitment to staying off-grid. Offer valuable goods or services, help them with a difficult task, or just show them you're not a Wire informant. It takes time, and it takes effort. But if you earn their respect, they can be valuable allies. They know how to survive off-grid, how to make a living without the Wires' interference. Just don't expect any official welcome. The Tangle operates on its own rules, and those rules are often unwritten."
