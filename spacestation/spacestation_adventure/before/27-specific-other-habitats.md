"Specific other habitats?" Wilkins leans back, a thoughtful expression on his face. "There's the 'Dust Bowl,' a mining colony out in the outer rim. Rough place, full of independent miners who don't care for the Wires' regulations. Then there's the 'Silent Watch,' an old research station, mostly abandoned now, but some say it still holds secrets. And countless others, small outposts, hidden away in asteroid fields or nebulae. They're not as well-known as the Tangle, but they offer the same thing: a chance to live free, away from the Wires' constant chatter. But they're also isolated, vulnerable. You're on your own out there."
