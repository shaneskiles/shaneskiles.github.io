You carefully examine a section of the Medbay wall that appears weakened. The metal is corroded and pitted, and you can see faint cracks radiating from a central point. It looks like it might give way with enough force, or with the right tool. You wonder what lies beyond this fragile barrier, and if breaching it is worth the risk. The air here is stagnant, and the silence is broken only by your own breathing.
