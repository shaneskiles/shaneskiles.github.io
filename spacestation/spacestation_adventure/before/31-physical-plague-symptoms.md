"The physical symptoms of the plague?" Wilkins shivers. "The official reports were vague, but the whispers... they spoke of rapid deterioration. Fever, tremors, then a strange, almost glassy look in the eyes. And then, the silence. No more chatter, no more connection to the Wires. But it wasn't a peaceful silence. It was a void. And some say, before the end, there were screams. Not of pain, but of something far worse. Of bodies twisting, of flesh decaying. It was a horror, writer. A true horror."
