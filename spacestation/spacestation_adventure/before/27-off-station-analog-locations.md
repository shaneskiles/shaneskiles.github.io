"Off-station analog tech locations?" Wilkins nods. "The fringe habitats are your best bet. The Tangle, especially. It's a hub for all sorts of independent traders and scavengers, and they deal in old-world tech. You'll find everything from pre-Collapse comms arrays to ancient mechanical computers. Other smaller outposts, hidden away in asteroid fields or nebulae, might also have some. They value that kind of independence, that freedom from the Wires' control. But getting there is half the battle, and you'll need to be prepared to trade, or to work for it."
