"Other fringe habitats?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're out there, scattered across the void. Most don't even have names, just designations. They're usually small, self-sufficient outposts, built by groups who wanted nothing to do with the Wires' control. Some are mining colonies, others are research stations, a few are just glorified pirate dens. They all share one thing in common: a fierce independence. But they're also isolated, vulnerable. The Wires don't actively patrol those areas, but they're always listening, always waiting for a chance to extend their reach."
