"The stubbornness of the target?" Wilkins chuckles, a grim sound. "The Wires hate it. They thrive on compliance, on predictability. Someone who refuses to break, who continues to defy them despite the pressure... that's a problem. They'll keep the pressure on, hoping you'll eventually make a mistake, hoping you'll break. They'll cut off your supplies, isolate you, spread rumors about you. They'll try to turn your friends against you. It's a war of wills, writer. And they have infinite patience. But sometimes, just sometimes, a stubborn enough target can outlast them. It's rare, but it happens."
