You begin to search for a hidden maintenance tunnel that might lead into the Abandoned Medbay. You sweep your datapad's light along the walls, examining the seams and looking for any signs of concealed access points. You recall a vague mention of maintenance tunnels connecting various sealed-off sections. The air remains stagnant, and the silence is broken only by your own breathing and the distant hum of the station. You hope to find a less conspicuous way in.
