"Analog power sources?" Wilkins gestures to a dusty corner of his shop. "Old-world batteries, hand-crank generators, anything that doesn't rely on the station's grid. They're not efficient, and they don't last forever, but they're secure. No Wire can tap into them, no algorithm can control them. You have to work for your power, but it's *your* power. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
