"Trading for food?" Wilkins nods. "Credits aren't always king out here. You can trade goods, services, even information. A rare mineral for a few weeks of rations, a piloting job for a supply of nutrient paste. The independent traders, the black markets... they deal in everything. But be careful. You're dealing with people who live outside the Wires' rules, and they can be ruthless. It's all about what you have that they need. It's a hard life, but a free one."
