"Temporary power disconnection?" Wilkins nods. "It's the simplest way to protect your devices. Remove their batteries, unplug them from any power source. If there's no power, there's no circuit to fry. But that means they're useless during the EMP. You'd be going completely dark, relying on analog tech and your own wits. It's a trade-off, writer. You either risk your tech, or you go dark. There's no foolproof way to protect everything when you're playing with that kind of power."
