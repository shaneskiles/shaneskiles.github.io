"The Wires' retaliation," Wilkins says, his voice low and serious. "They don't forget, and they don't forgive. If you hit them with an EMP, they'll send everything they have. Their standard security drones, of course, but also their specialized units. Trackers, infiltrators, even some of the older, more dangerous models they usually keep locked away. They'll lock down the area, scan for anomalies, and they won't stop until they find the source. They'll use their network, their influence, to make your life a living hell. It's a war of attrition, and they have infinite resources. You have to be fast, and you have to be smart, to survive their attention."
