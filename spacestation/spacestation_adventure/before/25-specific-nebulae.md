"Specific nebulae?" Wilkins leans back, a thoughtful expression on his face. "The Veil Nebula is the most famous, or infamous, depending on your perspective. It's a massive cloud of gas and dust, constantly shifting, constantly emitting strange electromagnetic radiation. The Wires' long-range sensors just get lost in it. It's like trying to hear a whisper in a hurricane. There are others, smaller ones, but the Veil is the granddaddy of them all. A true haven for those who want to disappear, if you can survive the journey."
