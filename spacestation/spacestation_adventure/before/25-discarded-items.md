You search the floor and surrounding areas for any discarded items or traces left by recent visitors. The bay is mostly clean, but you spot a small, metallic glint under a rusted container. You reach for it, and find what appears to be a non-standard data chip, its casing unlike anything you've seen on Mars. There are no other obvious personal items, no tools or discarded rations. It's as if anyone who comes here is very careful not to leave a trace.
