"Types of reinforced plating?" Wilkins taps a finger on his counter. "Asteroids aren't soft, writer. You need more than standard hull. Ablative armor, for one. It burns away on impact, dissipating the energy. Or reactive plating, which hardens on impact. It's expensive, and it adds weight, but it's the difference between surviving a field and becoming part of it. And even with all that, you still need a pilot who knows what they're doing. These aren't for joyrides, writer. These are for survival."
