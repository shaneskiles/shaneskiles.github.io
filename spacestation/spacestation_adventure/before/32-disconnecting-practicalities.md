"The practicalities of disconnecting devices?" Wilkins shrugs. "It depends on the device. Some are easy, just pull the battery or unplug a cable. Others are more complex, requiring tools or even partial disassembly. And then there's the time factor. If an EMP hits unexpectedly, you might not have time to disconnect everything. It's a trade-off, writer. You either risk your tech, or you go dark. There's no foolproof way to protect everything when you're playing with that kind of power."
