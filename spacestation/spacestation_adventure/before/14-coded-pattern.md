You decide to attempt a more complex, coded pattern on the bulkhead, hoping to convey a more specific message. You tap out a sequence, a series of long and short pulses, a rudimentary form of communication. The sounds echo in the profound silence of the observation deck, a deliberate attempt to break through the quiet. You listen intently for any reply, any sign that your coded message has been understood. The tension in the room is palpable, as if the very air is holding its breath.
