"The types of legitimate cargo handled?" Wilkins shrugs. "Food, water, raw materials, manufactured goods. Everything that keeps the station running, everything that the Wires deem necessary for a compliant society. It's all accounted for, all controlled. Every crate, every package, every single item is logged and tracked. It's efficient, yes, but it's also a cage. No room for secrets, no room for freedom. It's their domain, and they enforce their rules with extreme prejudice."
