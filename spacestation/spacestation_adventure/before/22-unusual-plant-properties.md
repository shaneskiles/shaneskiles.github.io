You observe the mutated plants for any unusual properties or effects. The faint glow from some specimens is intriguing, and the sweet, cloying scent in the air is becoming more pronounced. You wonder if these plants are bioluminescent, or if the glow is a sign of something else entirely. You also watch for any reactions to your presence, any subtle movements or changes in their appearance. The humid air and the rustle of unseen things add to the unsettling atmosphere.
