"What do these passages lead to?" Wilkins shrugs. "Other forgotten sections of the station, mostly. Places the Wires don't monitor. Old storage rooms, abandoned crew quarters, even some emergency shelters that were never used. Some say they even connect to the old research labs, where the real secrets are buried. Experiments, data, things the Wires want to keep hidden. But they're dangerous. Dark, cramped, and often unstable. And you never know what you'll find down there. Best to have a light, and a strong stomach."
