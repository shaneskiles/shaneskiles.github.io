"Analog tech, eh?" Wilkins grins, a glint in his eye. "It's the stuff the Wires can't touch. Old vacuum tube radios, mechanical calculators, even some of the ancient pre-Collapse navigation systems. No digital interface, no network connection, no way for them to inject their chatter or track your every move. It's clunky, slow, and takes a real hand to operate, but it's *yours*. No hidden backdoors, no remote shutdowns. Pure, unadulterated freedom, if you know how to use it. And if you can find it, of course. Most of it's been scrapped or buried in forgotten corners of the galaxy."
