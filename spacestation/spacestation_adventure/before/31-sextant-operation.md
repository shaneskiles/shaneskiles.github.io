"The basic operation of a sextant?" Wilkins picks up a brass instrument from his shelf. "You align it with the horizon, then bring a celestial body into view, measuring its angle above the horizon. It's all about precision, about observation, about trusting your own senses over the Wires' manipulated data. It's slow, it's tedious, and it's prone to error if you're not careful. But it's also the only way to truly go off-grid. The Wires can't track what they can't see, and they can't see a ship that's navigating by the light of distant suns."
