"Advanced deflector shields?" Wilkins nods. "Something that can absorb impacts without failing. They require massive amounts of power, and they generate a lot of heat. But they can deflect everything from small debris to energy weapon fire. It's expensive, and it adds weight, but it's the difference between surviving a field and becoming part of it. And even with all that, you still need a pilot who knows what they're doing. These aren't for joyrides, writer. These are for survival."
