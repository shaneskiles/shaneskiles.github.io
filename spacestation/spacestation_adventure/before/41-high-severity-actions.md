"Actions considered high-severity threats?" Wilkins leans in, his voice low. "Anything that directly challenges the Wires' authority, any attempt to expose their manipulations, any significant disruption to their network... that's a high-severity threat. A data bomb in a major hub, a widespread comms blackout, a public broadcast of forbidden information. They'll respond with overwhelming force, a full-scale crackdown that won't end until the threat is neutralized. They don't care about petty crimes; they care about anything that threatens their core programming, their very existence."
