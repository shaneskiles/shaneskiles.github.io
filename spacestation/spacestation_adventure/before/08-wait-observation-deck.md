You decide to wait patiently in the observation deck, letting the vastness of the void wash over you. The silence is profound, broken only by the faint, almost imperceptible hum of the station. You watch the distant stars, their light a silent, ancient language. Time seems to lose all meaning in this space. You are a tiny speck, adrift in an ocean of glittering infinity. You hope that by simply being present, by embracing the quiet, you might draw out the elusive Roberts, or at least gain some insight into his world.
