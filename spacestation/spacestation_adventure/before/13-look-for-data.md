You shift your attention to looking for data chips or any information storage devices. Your eyes scan the shelves, searching for anything that looks like a datapad, a memory stick, or an old-fashioned data chip. You notice the faint hum coming from a stack of old, deactivated comms equipment, and your gaze is drawn to a small, locked display case near the counter. Wilkins seems to be watching you more closely now, a subtle shift in his posture.
