You follow the faint glow, which leads you to a heavy, unlatched door labeled 'OBSERVATORY'. Pushing it open, you float into a chamber of absolute darkness. The only light comes from the breathtaking panorama of the star-dusted void. It's an overwhelming sight, a wall of silent, glittering infinity that seems to pull the very thoughts from your mind. This is a temple to emptiness. You drift into the room, your heart pounding, sensing that words are a currency without value here. This is a place of profound quiet. You are utterly alone, a tiny speck of life in an impossibly vast emptiness.
