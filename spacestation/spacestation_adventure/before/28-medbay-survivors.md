"Survivors from the medbay?" Wilkins scoffs. "Not a chance. If anyone survived, they wouldn't be the same. The Wires made sure of that. As for those who entered after it was sealed... fools, mostly. Scavengers looking for forgotten tech, or thrill-seekers looking for a scare. None of them ever came back the same. Some disappeared entirely. Others returned... changed. Mumbling about voices, about the Wires, about things they shouldn't have seen. The medbay has a way of getting inside your head, writer. Best to leave it alone."
