"Resource extraction and mining in these habitats?" Wilkins nods. "They mine rare minerals, harvest exotic gases. Things the Wires need but can't easily control. Exotic metals, rare earth elements, even some pre-Collapse alloys. The mining techniques are often crude, relying on old-world tech and sheer brute force. No Wire automation, no efficient extraction. It's dangerous work, and often unprofitable. But they're free. No Wire chatter, no constant surveillance. It's a hard life, but a free one. Just don't expect any luxuries out there. And be prepared to get your hands dirty."
