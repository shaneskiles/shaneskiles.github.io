Wilkins's expression darkens slightly at the mention of EMPs. "Now you're talking about serious business, writer. An electromagnetic pulse, a big enough one, can blind the Wires in an area, scramble their sensors, even temporarily shut down their local nodes. It's like screaming into their ears. But it's not a toy. A poorly deployed EMP can fry *your* systems just as easily as theirs. And it draws attention. A lot of attention. The Wires don't like being deafened, and they'll send their enforcers to find out who's making all that noise. It's a last resort, a desperate measure, not something you just casually deploy."
