"The nature of the data hub disruption on Haven?" Wilkins leans back, a distant look in his eyes. "Someone there, a brilliant but reckless data-ghost, managed to inject a massive data bomb into a major Wire data hub. It wasn't a physical attack, but a digital one. It corrupted a significant portion of their local network, causing widespread chaos and data loss. It was a direct challenge to their control, a slap in the face. The Wires couldn't let that stand. They responded with a full-scale lockdown, a siege. They wanted to make an example, to show everyone what happens when you truly defy them."
