"The feeling of being watched?" Wilkins shudders. "It's insidious, writer. The constant awareness that every comms burst, every data packet, every energy signature... they're building a profile on you. It wears you down, makes you paranoid. You start to censor your own thoughts, your own words, just in case they're listening. It's a cage without bars, a prison of the mind. You lose the sense of privacy, of true solitude. And it's very, very effective at breaking your spirit."
