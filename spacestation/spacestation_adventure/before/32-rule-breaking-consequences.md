"Consequences for breaking rules in the Tangle?" Wilkins shakes his head. "The Tangle might not have official law enforcement, but it has its own ways of dealing with troublemakers. Informal justice, mostly. You might find your ship sabotaged, your goods stolen, or yourself stranded in a dangerous sector. Or worse, you might find yourself exiled, abandoned in the void, with no way back. It's a harsh place, writer. And the consequences for breaking the unwritten laws can be brutal."
