You approach the stack of old, deactivated comms equipment, drawn by the faint hum. The devices are dusty and appear to be long out of use, but the hum suggests a residual power source, or perhaps something more. You run your hand over the cold metal, looking for any power buttons, data ports, or removable storage devices. Wilkins watches you from his counter, his expression unreadable. You wonder if these old comms units hold any hidden messages, or if they are simply relics of a bygone era.
