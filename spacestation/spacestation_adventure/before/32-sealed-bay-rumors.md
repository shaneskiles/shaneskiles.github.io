"Rumors of what's inside sealed bays?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're endless. Whispers of ancient alien artifacts, of forbidden technology, of creatures from the void. Some say there are entire ecosystems thriving in the darkness, untouched by the Wires. Others say it's just a graveyard, filled with the remains of those who dared to defy the system. Whatever the truth, the Wires keep a close eye on them, but they don't seem to want to open them. It's a mystery, writer. A dark one. And some mysteries are best left unsolved."
