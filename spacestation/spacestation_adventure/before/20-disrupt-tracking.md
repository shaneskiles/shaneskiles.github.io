"Disrupting their tracking?" Wilkins chuckles, a dry sound. "That's where the real fun begins. The Wires thrive on data, on signals. So you starve them. Analog tech, for one. No digital footprint, no easy way for them to trace. Old comms, manual controls, even some of the ancient pre-Wire machinery still floating around. Then there's the brute force approach: EMPs. Fry their local sensors, scramble their relays. Dangerous, messy, but effective in a pinch. And sometimes, the simplest thing is the hardest for them to track: pure, unadulterated silence. No comms, no data, no movement they can predict. Just a ghost in the machine."
