"Advanced physics and electromagnetic theory?" Wilkins shakes his head. "That's the kind of knowledge the Wires keep locked away. How to generate a powerful pulse, how to focus it, how to control it. It's the science of bending energy to your will. You'd have to be a genius, or have access to forbidden data, to even attempt it. Most people wouldn't even know where to start. But if you could pull it off, you'd have a powerful weapon against the Wires. A very dangerous weapon."
