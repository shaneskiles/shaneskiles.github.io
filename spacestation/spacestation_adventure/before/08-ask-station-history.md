You decide to change the subject, sensing Wilkins's reluctance to speak freely about Roberts. "This station... it looks like it's seen better days. What's its history? How did it end up like this?" Wilkins grunts, a flicker of something akin to pride in his eyes. "Terrapin Station," he begins, gesturing around his cluttered shop, "was once a bustling transit hub, a jewel in the outer rim. But then the Wires came, streamlining everything, making things 'efficient.' They built bigger, newer stations, and Terrapin was left to rot. Most folks left. The ones who stayed... well, we prefer the quiet. And the freedom from all that 'efficiency'."
