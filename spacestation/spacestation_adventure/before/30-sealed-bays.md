"The sealed-off bays," Wilkins says, his voice dropping to a whisper. "No one knows for sure what's in them, or why they were sealed. Some say dangerous experiments, others say forgotten treasures, or even the remains of a failed colony. The Wires keep a close eye on them, but they don't seem to want to open them. It's a mystery, writer. A dark one. And some mysteries are best left unsolved. Poking around in those places could attract unwanted attention, from the Wires, or from whatever is lurking inside."
