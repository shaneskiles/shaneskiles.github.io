"Physical hiding places?" Wilkins gestures around his cluttered shop. "This whole station's a hiding place, if you know where to look. The abandoned sections, the maintenance tunnels, even some of the old cargo bays. Places the Wires don't bother to monitor. They're dark, cold, and sometimes dangerous, but they're free. You can disappear in here, if you're careful. But you'll need supplies. And a good light source. And a strong will."
