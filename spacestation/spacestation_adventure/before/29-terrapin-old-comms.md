"Old communication devices found on Terrapin?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're usually in rough shape. Decades of neglect, dust, and the Wires' constant chatter have taken their toll. You might find a broken antenna, a corroded circuit board, or a power supply that's long dead. It takes a lot of work to get them operational, and even then, they're finicky. But they're pure. No digital interference, no Wire backdoors. They're a direct link to the past, and a potential lifeline for the future."
