"Specific other nebulae?" Wilkins shrugs. "There's the 'Ghost Cloud' near the outer rim. It's a strange one, full of faint, shifting energy signatures that play havoc with sensors. And the 'Whispering Mists' in the Perseus Arm. They're known for their unique acoustic properties, making it impossible for the Wires to get a clear signal. They're not as large or as famous as the Veil, but they offer the same thing: a place to disappear. But they're also dangerous, each with their own unique hazards. You need to know what you're getting into before you venture into them."
