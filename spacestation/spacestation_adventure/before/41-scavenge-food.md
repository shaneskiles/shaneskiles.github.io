"Scavenging for food?" Wilkins shrugs. "It's a long shot, writer. Most of the old rations in abandoned sections are long expired, or contaminated. You might find some nutrient paste, some dehydrated goods, but it's rare. And you have to be careful. Some places are sealed for a reason, and you don't want to stumble into a biohazard. It's a desperate measure, but sometimes, it's the only option. It's a hard life, but a free one."
