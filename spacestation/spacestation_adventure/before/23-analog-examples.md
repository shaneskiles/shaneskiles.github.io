"Examples of analog tech?" Wilkins gestures around his shop. "You're looking at some of it. This old comms unit, for instance. Pure vacuum tubes, no digital processing. You have to tune it by hand, listen for the static, but it's secure. No Wire can tap into it. Or these old navigation charts. Paper, ink, and a sextant. Takes a real pilot to use them, but they don't lie. No hidden routes, no manipulated data. It's all about trusting your own senses, not some algorithm."
