"The types of ships seen in Bay 7?" Wilkins shrugs. "Mostly small, independent vessels. Freighters, couriers, sometimes even a modified pleasure craft. They're usually old, patched-together, and designed for discretion, not speed or firepower. They come and go, usually under the cover of darkness, or during a shift change when the Wires' monitoring is less vigilant. They're moving everything from rare minerals to forbidden data, things that wouldn't pass through official channels. It's a constant dance, a game of cat and mouse with the Wires. But for those who value freedom over compliance, Bay 7 is a lifeline."
