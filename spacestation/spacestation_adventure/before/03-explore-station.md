You decide to explore the station on your own, hoping to stumble upon something interesting or find Roberts by chance. The station is a maze of dimly lit corridors, many of them completely dark, forcing you to rely on the faint glow of your datapad. The silence is unnerving, broken only by the distant hum of life support and the occasional creak of stressed metal. You pass sealed-off sections, their purpose long forgotten, and notice exposed wiring snaking along the bulkheads. The decay is pervasive, a constant reminder of the station's age and neglect.
