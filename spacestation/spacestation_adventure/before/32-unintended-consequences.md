"The unintended consequences or failures?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It went horribly wrong. Minds shattered, bodies twisted. The subjects became... something else. Not human, not Wire. Just broken. The Wires sealed it off, declared it a failure. But some say, it wasn't a failure at all. Just a different kind of success. A new form of consciousness, perhaps. Or a new kind of horror. Whatever it was, the Wires don't want anyone looking too closely. They want that medbay forgotten."
