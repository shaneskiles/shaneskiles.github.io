"A powerful electromagnetic coil?" Wilkins nods. "You can salvage one from an old thruster, a power generator, or even a decommissioned industrial magnet. It's the part that converts the stored energy into the pulse. It needs to be robust, capable of handling a massive surge of power without burning out. It's easier to find than the capacitors, but still requires a keen eye and a bit of luck. And even if you find one, you need the knowledge to integrate it into your EMP device without blowing yourself up."
