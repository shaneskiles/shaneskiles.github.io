"Illicit cargo," Wilkins says, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "That's where things get interesting, and dangerous. We're talking about anything the Wires have deemed illegal: unsanctioned tech, forbidden data, even certain types of information. Sometimes it's volatile chemicals, unstable power cells, or even dormant automated defenses. It's usually smuggled in through the decommissioned bays, or hidden in plain sight. But dealing with it means dealing with the kind of people who don't mind breaking the rules. And the Wires are always watching, always waiting for a chance to crack down."
