You decide to investigate the Hydroponics Level for vulnerabilities in the station's life support systems. You know that this level, with its complex network of water pipes and air ducts, could be a critical point. You carefully examine the exposed conduits and machinery, looking for any signs of wear, damage, or deliberate tampering. The hum of the life support system is more pronounced here, a constant reminder of its vital role. You wonder if the Wires, or anyone else, might exploit such weaknesses.
