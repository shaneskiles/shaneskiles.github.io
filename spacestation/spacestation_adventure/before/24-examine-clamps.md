You carefully examine the magnetic docking clamps in Cargo Bay 7. They are massive, rusted mechanisms, designed to secure large vessels. You look for any unusual wear patterns, scratches, or deformations that might indicate a non-standard vessel has docked here. The metal is cold and rough, and the silence of the bay is profound. You wonder if Roberts's *Lacuna*, with its seamless hull, would leave any discernible marks. You're looking for a ghost, a subtle trace of something that shouldn't be here.
