"Ship modifications for asteroid fields?" Wilkins nods. "You'll need more than just a fresh coat of paint. Enhanced thrusters, for one. You need to be able to change direction on a dime, dodge incoming rocks. Then there's reinforced plating. Asteroids aren't soft. And a good deflector shield, something that can absorb impacts without failing. It's expensive, and it adds weight, but it's the difference between surviving a field and becoming part of it. And even with all that, you still need a pilot who knows what they're doing."
