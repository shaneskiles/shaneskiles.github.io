You begin to search for hidden access tunnels within Cargo Bay 7. The vastness of the bay makes it difficult, but you eventually spot a small, almost invisible hatch tucked away behind a stack of old, rusted containers. It's unlit and appears to lead into a narrow, dark passage. The air coming from it is cold and still, carrying a faint metallic scent. You wonder where these tunnels lead and what secrets they might hold.
