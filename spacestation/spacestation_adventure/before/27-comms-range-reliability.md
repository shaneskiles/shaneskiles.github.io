"Old comms range and reliability?" Wilkins sighs. "They're not built for long-range, writer. You're lucky to get a clear signal across a few sectors. And reliability? They're finicky. Prone to static, interference, and sudden breakdowns. You need to know how to maintain them, how to troubleshoot them on the fly. It's a constant battle against entropy. But that's the trade-off for security. The Wires' network is vast and reliable, but it's also a cage. These old comms are a lifeline, but a fragile one."
