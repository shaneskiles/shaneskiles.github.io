"Unwritten laws or customs in the Tangle?" Wilkins chuckles. "There aren't any, officially. It's a place of pure freedom, and pure chaos. But there are unwritten laws, customs that everyone understands. Don't steal, don't cheat, don't draw unwanted attention from the Wires. And most importantly, don't mess with another person's ship. Break those rules, and you'll find yourself in a world of trouble. The Tangle might not have official law enforcement, but it has its own ways of dealing with troublemakers. And they're usually not pleasant."
