"Power sources and light?" Wilkins gestures to a dusty corner of his shop. "Old-world batteries, hand-crank generators, anything that doesn't rely on the station's grid. The Wires will cut the power, plunge you into darkness. You need your own light, your own energy. Chemical glow sticks, old-fashioned lanterns, anything that doesn't emit a digital signature. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
