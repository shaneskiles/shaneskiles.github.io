You begin to meticulously search the observation deck, your datapad's light cutting through the profound darkness. The room is sparse, mostly just the vast viewport and a few scattered, dusty consoles. You run your hands along the cold metal bulkheads, feeling for any seams or hidden panels. The silence is absolute, amplifying every rustle of your clothes, every faint creak of the station's structure. You're looking for anything out of place, any sign that someone else has been here, or that something is hidden within this silent sanctuary.
