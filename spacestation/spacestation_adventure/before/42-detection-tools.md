"Specialized tools for detection?" Wilkins shrugs. "Sonic scanners, thermal imaging, anything that can see through walls. But most of that tech is controlled by the Wires, or too expensive for us independent types. Your best bet is old-world schematics, blueprints of the station before the Wires got their hands on it. They might show hidden passages, forgotten rooms. But even then, you have to be careful. The Wires don't want you digging into the past, and they've made sure to make it difficult."
