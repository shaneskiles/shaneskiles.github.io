"The medbay," Wilkins shivers slightly, despite the station's regulated temperature. "Sealed off for decades. Some say it was a plague, others a failed experiment. Whatever it was, the Wires declared it a 'containment zone' and locked it down. No active systems, no chatter, just a cold, sterile silence. It's a perfect place to disappear, if you can get in. But be warned, writer. Some places are sealed for a reason. And the Wires don't forget. They just... wait."
