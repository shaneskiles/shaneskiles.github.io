"Other nebulae properties?" Wilkins nods. "Some are electromagnetic storms, constantly crackling with energy, frying anything digital that gets too close. Others are pockets of exotic matter, strange particles that distort space-time and scramble signals. They're all different, but they all share one thing in common: they're dangerous. And they're usually far off the beaten path, places only desperate pilots or those with a death wish would venture. But if you can navigate them, they offer a level of anonymity that the Wires can't penetrate."
