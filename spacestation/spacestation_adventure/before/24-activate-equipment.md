You attempt to activate the old loading equipment in Cargo Bay 7. You find a main console, its screen dark and covered in dust. You press the power button, but nothing happens. The faint hum persists, suggesting some residual power, but not enough to bring the system online. You wonder if it's simply dead, or if it requires a specific sequence of actions to activate. The silence of the bay is profound, and you feel a growing sense of frustration.
