"Acquiring analog tech... that's the tricky part," Wilkins says, rubbing his chin. "Most of it's been phased out, scrapped, or just forgotten. On Terrapin, you might find some in the deeper, unmonitored sections, like the old cargo bays or the abandoned medbay. Scavengers sometimes stumble upon it. Off-station, your best bet is the fringe habitats, places like the Tangle. They value that kind of independence. But it won't be cheap, and it won't be easy. The Wires don't like it when people go off-grid, and they've made sure to make it difficult."
