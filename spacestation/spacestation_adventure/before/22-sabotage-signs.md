You meticulously search for any signs of sabotage or tampering on the life support systems. You run your hands along the conduits, looking for fresh scratches, pry marks, or any evidence of deliberate damage. The dust is thick in most places, but you look for disturbed areas, or any discarded tools that might have been left behind. The thought of someone intentionally harming the station's life support sends a chill down your spine. You wonder who would do such a thing, and why.
