"The different factions or groups within the Tangle?" Wilkins shrugs. "It's a motley crew. Scavengers, independent traders, exiles, those who just want to be left alone. They're fiercely independent, and they don't trust outsiders easily. Some operate in small, tight-knit groups, others are lone wolves. They have their own codes, their own territories, and their own rivalries. But if you earn their respect, they can be valuable allies. They know how to survive off-grid, how to make a living without the Wires' interference. Just don't expect any official welcome. The Tangle operates on its own rules, and those rules are often unwritten."
