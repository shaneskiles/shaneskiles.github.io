"Dormant automated defenses or other dangers in abandoned sections?" Wilkins shrugs. "Old security systems that are still active, waiting for a trigger. Laser grids, automated turrets, even some rudimentary drones. They're usually offline, but a power surge or a misplaced step could activate them. And then there's the wildlife. Rats, insects, even some mutated flora that can be dangerous. And other scavengers, desperate and ruthless. You never know what you'll stumble upon in those forgotten corners. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the Wires don't patrol these areas, but that doesn't mean they're safe."
