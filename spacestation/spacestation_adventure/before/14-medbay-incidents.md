"Incidents?" Wilkins's face darkens. "There were a few. Nothing official, of course. The Wires scrubbed all the records. But whispers persist. Strange illnesses, sudden disappearances. Some say it was a failed experiment, a bioweapon gone wrong. Others say it was a deliberate culling, a way to get rid of 'undesirables'. Whatever it was, it was bad enough for the Wires to seal the whole section off and pretend it never happened. That's how they operate, writer. Silence is their weapon."
