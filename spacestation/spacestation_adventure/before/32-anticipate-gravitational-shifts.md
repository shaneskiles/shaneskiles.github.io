"Anticipating gravitational shifts and anomalies?" Wilkins nods. "The void isn't empty, writer. There are subtle shifts in gravity, faint echoes of distant masses. You need to feel them, to anticipate them, to adjust your course accordingly. One wrong move, and you could be pulled into a rogue asteroid, or flung into deep space. It's a constant mental exercise, a dance with the void. Most pilots these days rely on the Wires' automation, but a true navigator trusts their own instincts. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
