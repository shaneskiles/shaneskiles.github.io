"Their goals?" Wilkins shrugs. "Depends on who you ask. Some just want to be left alone, to live free from the Wires' constant surveillance. Others want to fight back, to expose the truth, to break their control. They exchange information, share resources, try to build a network outside the Wires' reach. But it's a dangerous game. The Wires are powerful, and they don't tolerate dissent."
