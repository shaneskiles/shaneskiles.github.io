"The Ghost Cloud near the outer rim?" Wilkins shrugs. "It's a strange one, full of faint, shifting energy signatures that play havoc with sensors. It's like a digital fog, obscuring everything. The Wires' long-range comms just get lost in it. It's not as large or as famous as the Veil, but it offers the same thing: a place to disappear. But it's also dangerous, with its own unique hazards. You need to know what you're getting into before you venture into it."
