"The Whispering Mists in the Perseus Arm?" Wilkins nods. "They're known for their unique acoustic properties, making it impossible for the Wires to get a clear signal. It's like a constant, low hum, a white noise that drowns out everything digital. It's not as large or as famous as the Veil, but it offers the same thing: a place to disappear. But it's also dangerous, with its own unique hazards. You need to know what you're getting into before you venture into it."
