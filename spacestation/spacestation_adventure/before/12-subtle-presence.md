You decide to attempt to make your presence known subtly, hoping to draw out Roberts without startling him. You consider a soft sound, or perhaps leaving a small, noticeable item. The silence of the observation deck is so profound that even the slightest disturbance would be amplified. You want to signal your presence, but in a way that respects the quiet, a language Roberts seems to understand.
