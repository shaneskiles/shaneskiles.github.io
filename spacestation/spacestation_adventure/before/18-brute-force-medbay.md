You continue to apply brute force to the heavily sealed Medbay door. You push and pull, straining against the rusted metal. The door groans and creaks, but remains stubbornly shut. Dust rains down from the frame, and the air fills with the scent of old metal. You're making progress, but it's slow and arduous. You wonder if the noise you're making will attract unwanted attention, or if the door will simply give way.
