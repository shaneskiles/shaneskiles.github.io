"The skills required for building an EMP?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's not for amateurs, writer. You'd need a solid understanding of basic electronics, circuitry, how power flows. And then, for a truly effective EMP, you'd need advanced physics, electromagnetic theory. How to generate a powerful pulse, how to focus it, how to control it. It's the kind of knowledge the Wires keep locked away. You'd have to be a genius, or have access to forbidden data, to even attempt it. Most people wouldn't even know where to start."
