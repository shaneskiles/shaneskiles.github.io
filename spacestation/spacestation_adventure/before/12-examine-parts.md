You begin to examine the piles of salvaged parts, your fingers brushing against cold metal, frayed wires, and cracked plastic. It's a chaotic assortment of components from various ships and station modules, some recognizable, others completely alien. The dust is thick, and the air smells faintly of ozone and old oil. You're looking for anything that stands out, anything that might be valuable, or more importantly, anything that could offer a clue about Roberts or the *Lacuna*.
