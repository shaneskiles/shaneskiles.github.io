"Forgotten personal effects or data in hidden rooms?" Wilkins leans in, his voice a low murmur. "Old datapads, personal diaries, even physical photos. Things people wanted to keep hidden from the Wires, things that held their true identities, their true thoughts. It's a glimpse into the lives of those who defied the system, a testament to their stubbornness. But accessing it is another matter. Most of the old systems are dead, or require specialized knowledge to reactivate. And even if you get it, who knows what you'll find? The truth can be a heavy burden, writer. A very heavy burden."
