"Physical security measures in Bay 7?" Wilkins shrugs. "Mostly old locks and rusted gates. Nothing a determined individual couldn't bypass with the right tools and a bit of patience. The real security is the reputation of the place. Everyone knows it's a place for illicit dealings, and those who operate there tend to be... self-reliant. They don't need the Wires to keep order. They have their own ways. But it's still a good idea to be discreet. You don't want to draw unwanted attention, from the Wires, or from the other inhabitants."
