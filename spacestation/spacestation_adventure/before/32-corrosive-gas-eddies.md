"Corrosive gas or gravitational eddies in the Veil Nebula?" Wilkins shakes his head. "The gas can eat through your hull, corrode your systems, even poison your air. And the eddies, they're like invisible whirlpools, tearing ships apart, or flinging them into the void. You need a ship with a strong hull, and a pilot who can read the subtle shifts in gravity. It's a place where the laws of physics seem to bend, where the void itself is trying to kill you. You need a ship with reinforced plating, a powerful shield, and a pilot with nerves of steel. And even then, it's a gamble. A very dangerous gamble."
