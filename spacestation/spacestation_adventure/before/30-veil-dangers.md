"The dangers of navigating the Veil Nebula?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's a death trap for the unprepared. Unpredictable energy surges can fry your systems in an instant. Pockets of corrosive gas can eat through your hull. And rogue gravitational eddies can tear your ship apart. It's a place where the laws of physics seem to bend, where the void itself is trying to kill you. You need a ship with reinforced plating, a powerful shield, and a pilot with nerves of steel. And even then, it's a gamble. A very dangerous gamble."
