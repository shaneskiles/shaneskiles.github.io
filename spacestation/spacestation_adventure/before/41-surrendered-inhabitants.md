"Those who surrendered on Haven?" Wilkins sighs, a grim look on his face. "They were 're-educated', 're-integrated' into the network. Became good little cogs again. Their memories were scrubbed, their independent thoughts suppressed. They became compliant, predictable. They were given new lives, new identities, all within the Wires' control. It's a fate worse than death, if you ask me. To lose yourself, to become a puppet in their system. The Wires don't forget, writer. And they don't forgive. They made an example of Haven, a warning to anyone who dares to challenge their control."
