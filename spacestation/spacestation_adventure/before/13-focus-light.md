You focus your datapad's light on a specific area of interest in the shadows. The beam reveals a faint glint of metal tucked away behind a dusty console, and a strange discoloration on the wall nearby. The air is still and cold, and the silence of the room is absolute. You wonder if these are just random anomalies, or if they are clues left behind by Roberts, or perhaps even the Wires themselves. The darkness still holds many secrets, but your light is beginning to peel back the layers.
