"Improving the reliability of old comms?" Wilkins sighs. "It's a constant battle against entropy. Regular maintenance, replacing worn-out components, that's key. And shielding against interference. The Wires' chatter is everywhere, and it can easily disrupt a fragile analog signal. It's a lot of work, and it's never perfect. But every clear transmission, every uninterrupted conversation, is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
