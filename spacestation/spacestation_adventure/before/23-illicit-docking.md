You begin to search for signs of recent activity or illicit docking in Cargo Bay 7. Your eyes scan the floor for scuff marks, fresh oil stains, or anything that suggests a ship has recently been here. You examine the magnetic docking clamps, looking for unusual wear patterns or modifications that might indicate a non-standard vessel. The air is still, but you imagine the silent comings and goings of those who prefer to operate outside the Wires' watchful eye. You wonder if Roberts's *Lacuna* has ever docked here.
