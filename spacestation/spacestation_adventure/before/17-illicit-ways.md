"Illicit ways?" The young mechanic glances around Wilkins's shop, his voice dropping to a whisper. "There are whispers, of course. About independent pilots, folks who operate outside the Wires' network. They call 'em 'sleepwalkers'. They move cargo, sometimes people, for the right price. But it's dangerous. The Wires don't like loose ends. And if you get caught... well, you don't want to get caught. But if you're desperate enough, and you know the right people, there might be a way."
