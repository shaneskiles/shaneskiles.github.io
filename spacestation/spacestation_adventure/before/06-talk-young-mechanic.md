You approach the young man working diligently beside Wilkins. He looks up, wiping grease from his brow with the back of his hand. His eyes, though tired, hold a spark of ambition. "Can I help you?" he asks, his voice surprisingly clear amidst the clatter of tools. He seems eager, perhaps even a little bored with his current task. You notice a worn, dog-eared book on his workbench, its cover depicting a sleek, interstellar freighter.
