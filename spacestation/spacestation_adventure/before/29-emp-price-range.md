"The typical price range for an EMP device?" Wilkins scoffs. "More than you can imagine, writer. We're talking about a small fortune in credits, or a trade of something equally valuable. These aren't mass-produced items; they're custom-made, highly illegal, and incredibly dangerous. The sellers know their worth, and they'll squeeze every last credit out of you. And there's no guarantee it would even work. Most of them are cobbled-together junk, more likely to explode in your face than disable a Wire. It's a desperate measure, and usually a very expensive one."
