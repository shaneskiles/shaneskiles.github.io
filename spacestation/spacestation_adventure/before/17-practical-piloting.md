"Practical experience?" The young mechanic sighs, a wistful look in his eyes. "Not much, honestly. Wilkins lets me run diagnostics on the occasional derelict he drags in, and I've done some minor repairs on shuttle engines. But actually *flying* a ship... that's a different story. You need permits, licenses, and a ship that isn't held together with duct tape and prayers. Still, I've spent countless hours in simulators. I know the theory inside and out. I could fly anything, given the chance."
