"Specific cargo bays?" Wilkins taps a finger on his chin. "Bay 7 is the one I mentioned. It's mostly empty now, used for temporary storage or illicit transfers. The Wires don't bother with it much, too much old tech interfering with their sensors. There are other bays, of course, but they're either active and heavily monitored, or completely sealed off. Bay 7 is your best bet for a quiet corner, if you're looking to hide or conduct some... unsanctioned business."
