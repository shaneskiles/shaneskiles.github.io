"The precision and limitations of a sextant?" Wilkins nods. "It's a precise instrument, but it's only as good as the hand that holds it. Environmental conditions, ship movement, even your own eyesight can affect its accuracy. It's slow, it's tedious, and it's prone to error if you're not careful. But it's also the only way to truly go off-grid. The Wires can't track what they can't see, and they can't see a ship that's navigating by the light of distant suns. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
