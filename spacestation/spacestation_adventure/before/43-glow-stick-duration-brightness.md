"The duration and brightness of glow sticks?" Wilkins shrugs. "A few hours, maybe a full shift if you're lucky. They're not bright enough to illuminate a large area, but they're good for close-up work, for navigating tight spaces, for signaling without emitting a digital signature. The chemical reaction is finite, and once it starts, it can't be stopped. They're cheap, disposable, and a lifesaver in a blackout. But don't expect them to light up a whole cargo bay. They're for personal use, for staying hidden."
