"The difficulty of accessing forgotten data?" Wilkins sighs. "Most of the old systems are dead, or require specialized knowledge to reactivate. You'd need to be a tech-head, someone who understands ancient operating systems and forgotten protocols. And even if you get it, the data might be corrupted, encrypted, or just plain useless. The Wires don't want you digging into the past, and they've made sure to make it difficult. But if you can crack it, the truth can be a heavy burden, writer. A very heavy burden."
