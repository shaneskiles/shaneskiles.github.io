"Troubleshooting breakdowns in old comms?" Wilkins nods. "When something breaks, you can't just call a tech. You have to fix it yourself, with whatever parts you can scavenge. It's about understanding the circuitry, identifying the faulty component, and finding a way to replace it or bypass it. It's a constant battle against entropy, against the decay of old tech. But every time you bring a dead comms unit back to life, it's a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
