"Physical damage to components?" Wilkins taps a finger on his counter. "The EMP can literally burn out circuits, melt wires, even crack microchips. Your datapad becomes a brick, your comms unit a paperweight. It's not just a software issue; it's a hardware failure. Repairing it is often impossible, and replacing components can be expensive and difficult. It's a harsh lesson, writer. When you use an EMP, you're not just disrupting the Wires; you're disrupting everything digital around you. It's a sacrifice, a necessary one if you want to go truly dark, but a sacrifice nonetheless."
