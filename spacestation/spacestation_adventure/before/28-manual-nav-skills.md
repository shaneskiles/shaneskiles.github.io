"The skills needed for manual navigation?" Wilkins smiles, a rare, genuine smile. "It's more than just knowing how to use the tools, writer. It's about intuition, about a deep understanding of the cosmos. You need to be able to read the stars, to understand their movements, their patterns. You need to be able to plot a course in your head, to anticipate gravitational shifts, solar flares, rogue asteroids. It's a constant mental exercise, a dance with the void. Most pilots these days rely on the Wires' automation, but a true navigator trusts their own instincts. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
