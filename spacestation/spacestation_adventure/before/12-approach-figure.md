You spot a lone figure in the distance, drifting slowly down a dimly lit corridor. Their back is to you, and they seem to be examining something on the wall. Their movements are slow and deliberate, almost ethereal in the low gravity. You can't make out any details from this distance, but their presence is a stark contrast to the usual emptiness of these passages. You wonder if they are a resident, a fellow traveler, or something else entirely. Your heart beats a little faster as you consider whether to approach.
