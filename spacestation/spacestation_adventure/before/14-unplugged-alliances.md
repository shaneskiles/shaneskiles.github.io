"Alliances?" Wilkins raises an eyebrow, a cynical smile playing on his lips. "Some folks try. They gather in the quiet places, exchanging encrypted data packets, whispering about resistance. They call themselves 'sleepwalkers' too, sometimes. But it's a fragile thing, trust, out here. Especially when the Wires are always listening, always looking for patterns. One wrong move, one compromised link, and the whole thing unravels. Roberts... he's a lone wolf. Always has been. Doesn't trust easily, and for good reason."
