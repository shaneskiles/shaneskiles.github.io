"The function of a sextant?" Wilkins picks up a brass instrument from his shelf. "It's an ancient device, but still effective. You use it to measure the angles between celestial bodies, to plot your position. It's all about precision, about observation, about trusting your own senses over the Wires' manipulated data. It's slow, it's tedious, and it's prone to error if you're not careful. But it's also the only way to truly go off-grid. The Wires can't track what they can't see, and they can't see a ship that's navigating by the light of distant suns."
