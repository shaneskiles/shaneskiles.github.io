"The secrets rumored to be held there?" Wilkins nods. "Data that could expose the Wires' true nature, their origins, their ultimate goals. Blueprints for technologies that could challenge their control. Or perhaps, something far more sinister. Experiments that went horribly wrong, entities that were left behind. It's a dangerous place, writer. And the silence can be deafening. You might find what you're looking for, but you might also find something you wish you hadn't."
