Instead of forcing the main door, you decide to look for an alternative entrance or a hidden passage into the Abandoned Medbay. You sweep your datapad's light along the walls, examining the seams and looking for any signs of concealed access points. The schematics on your datapad are too old to be reliable, but you recall a vague mention of maintenance tunnels connecting various sealed-off sections. The air remains stagnant, and the silence is broken only by your own breathing and the distant hum of the station.
