"The types of analog tech found in the medbay?" Wilkins shivers slightly. "Old diagnostic tools, manual surgical instruments, even some pre-Collapse medical equipment. It's all analog, no Wire connection. But it's a dangerous place. The Wires sealed it off for a reason, and whatever happened in there... it left its mark. You might find what you're looking for, but you might also find something you wish you hadn't. It's a place where sanity goes to die."
