"What can I help with?" you ask, looking at the half-disassembled conduit. The young mechanic gestures to it. "This power conduit. It's a mess. The wiring's corroded, and the power fluctuations are getting worse. Wilkins just told me to 'make it work'. It's a two-person job, usually. One to hold the connections, the other to re-route the power. You ever worked with old station tech?"
