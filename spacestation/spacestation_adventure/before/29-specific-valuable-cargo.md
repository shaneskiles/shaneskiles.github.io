"Specific valuable cargo?" Wilkins grins. "Old Earth artifacts, for one. Relics from before the Collapse, before the Wires took over. They're rare, and highly sought after by collectors. Then there's pre-Collapse tech, things that operate outside the Wires' network. And suppressed data, information the Wires don't want you to see. It could be anything from historical records to blueprints for forbidden technology. It's all valuable, all dangerous. And all worth risking your neck for, if you're brave enough."
