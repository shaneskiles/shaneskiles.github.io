You sweep your datapad's light along the walls of the dark tunnel, searching for any emergency lights. You spot a few, but they are either completely dark or flickering weakly, barely illuminating their immediate surroundings. You approach one that seems to be flickering more consistently, hoping to find a way to activate it fully. The air is cold and still, and the sounds of the tunnel seem to amplify your own breathing. You know that proper illumination would make this area much safer to navigate.
