You decide to leave a small, noticeable item in the center of the observation deck, hoping it will signal your presence to Roberts. You consider leaving your datapad, or a small, personal item. The idea is to leave a trace, a sign that someone has been here, and is looking for contact. The silence of the room is profound, and you feel a strange sense of vulnerability as you leave a piece of yourself behind.
