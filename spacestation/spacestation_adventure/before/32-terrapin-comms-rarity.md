"The rarity of functional old comms on Terrapin?" Wilkins sighs. "They're almost non-existent. Most have been scrapped, or are too damaged to repair. Finding a working unit is like finding a needle in a haystack. But if you do, it's worth its weight in gold. No Wire can track it, no algorithm can control it. It's a direct link to the past, and a potential lifeline for the future. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
