"Personal diaries or forbidden information?" Wilkins leans in, his voice a low murmur. "These are the real treasures, writer. The unfiltered thoughts of those who lived before the Wires took over. Their hopes, their fears, their defiance. And forbidden information, things the Wires have suppressed. It could be anything from the true history of the Collapse to blueprints for technologies that could challenge their control. It's all valuable, all dangerous. And all worth risking your neck for, if you're brave enough to dig through the digital dust."
