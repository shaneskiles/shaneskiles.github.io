"The fate of the target in that crackdown, on Haven?" Wilkins sighs, a grim look on his face. "Most of the inhabitants either surrendered, hoping for leniency from the Wires. They were 're-educated', 're-integrated' into the network. Became good little cogs again. The ones who didn't surrender... well, they just disappeared. Their comms went silent, their ships vanished. Haven is a ghost station now, a monument to defiance. The Wires don't forget, writer. And they don't forgive. They made an example of Haven, a warning to anyone who dares to challenge their control."
