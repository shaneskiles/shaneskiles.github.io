"Rival scavengers or traders?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're just as desperate as you are, and they won't hesitate to cut your throat for a valuable find. They operate in the shadows, in the decommissioned sections, in the forgotten wrecks. They'll try to beat you to a find, or steal it from you once you've found it. Some are lone wolves, others operate in small, ruthless gangs. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the stakes are high. One wrong move, and you could end up in a Wire detention center, or worse, floating in the void."
