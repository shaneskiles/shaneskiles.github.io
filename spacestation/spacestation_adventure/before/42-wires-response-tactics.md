"The Wires' response tactics to the Haven disruption?" Wilkins sighs, a grim look on his face. "They responded with a full-scale lockdown, a siege. No comms in or out, no supply ships, constant drone patrols. They starved them out, writer. Made an example of them. It was a grim reminder of what happens when you truly defy the Wires. They wanted to show everyone what happens when you challenge their control. It was a brutal, relentless response, designed to break the spirit of anyone who dared to resist."
