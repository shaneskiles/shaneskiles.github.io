You venture into the darker corners of the observation deck, where the starlight barely reaches. The air here is colder, and the dust motes dance in the faint beam of your datapad's light. You can feel the station's age in these neglected spaces, the subtle vibrations of its structure, the faint scent of ozone and old metal. You meticulously check behind consoles, under ledges, and along the seams of the bulkheads, searching for anything that might be hidden from casual view. The silence is profound, making you feel utterly alone in this vast, dark chamber.
