"Recent activity in Bay 7?" Wilkins shrugs. "It's always a quiet hum of unsanctioned business. Small freighters, independent couriers, sometimes even a modified pleasure craft. They come and go, usually under the cover of darkness, or during a shift change when the Wires' monitoring is less vigilant. They're moving everything from rare minerals to forbidden data, things that wouldn't pass through official channels. It's a constant dance, a game of cat and mouse with the Wires. But for those who value freedom over compliance, Bay 7 is a lifeline."
