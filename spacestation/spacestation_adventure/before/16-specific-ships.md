"Specific types of ships?" The young mechanic's eyes light up. "I've studied everything. Cargo haulers, passenger liners, even some old military frigates. The schematics are all online, if you know where to look. But the real challenge is understanding their quirks, their hidden flaws. Every ship has a personality, you know? And the older they are, the more character they have. I've spent hours in simulators, flying every model imaginable. I could tell you the stress points on a 'Stardust' class hauler, or the optimal jump trajectory for a 'Voidcruiser' scout."
