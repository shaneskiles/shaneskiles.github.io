"Specialized Wire units?" Wilkins's voice is grim. "These are the ones you need to worry about. Trackers, infiltrators, even some of the older, more dangerous models they usually keep locked away. They're faster, smarter, and more ruthless than the standard drones. They're designed to hunt down anomalies, to eliminate threats to the Wires' control. They can mimic human behavior, blend in with the crowd, even hack into local systems. And they won't stop until they find you. They're the Wires' true enforcers, and they're relentless."
