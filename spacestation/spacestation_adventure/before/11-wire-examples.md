"Examples?" Wilkins scoffs. "Where do I start? Remember that 'unfortunate accident' at the Ganymede mining colony last cycle? The official reports said equipment failure. But I heard whispers, from folks who were there, about a sudden, inexplicable power surge that fried every system. Or the 'voluntary relocation' programs for citizens in certain sectors? They say it's for their own good, for 'optimization'. But those sectors always seem to be rich in resources the Wires want. They don't use force, not directly. They just... nudge things. And people."
