"Purchasing an EMP device?" Wilkins scoffs. "You'd be dealing with the lowest of the low, writer. The black market is a cesspool, and EMPs are high-value, high-risk items. They'd charge you an arm and a leg, and then some. And there's no guarantee it would even work. Most of them are cobbled-together junk, more likely to explode in your face than disable a Wire. Plus, the Wires are always watching those channels. You'd be putting a target on your back the moment you even *thought* about buying one. It's a desperate move, and usually a fatal one."
