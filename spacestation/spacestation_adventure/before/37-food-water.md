"Non-perishable food and water?" Wilkins nods. "You need enough to last, at least a few weeks, maybe a month. Dehydrated rations, nutrient paste, anything that won't spoil. And water. Plenty of water. The station's recycling system might be throttled, or even shut down during a crackdown. You need your own supply, and a way to purify it. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
