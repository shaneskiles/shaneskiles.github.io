"Chemical glow sticks and their duration?" Wilkins nods. "They're not bright, and they don't last forever, but they're secure. No Wire can track them, no algorithm can control them. A few hours, maybe a full shift if you're lucky. They're good for close-up work, for navigating tight spaces, for signaling without emitting a digital signature. They're cheap, disposable, and a lifesaver in a blackout. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
