"Advanced gyroscopic stabilizers?" Wilkins nods. "They keep your ship steady in chaotic environments, like asteroid fields or nebulae. They counteract sudden shifts in momentum, prevent your ship from tumbling out of control. It's expensive, and it adds weight, but it's the difference between surviving a field and becoming part of it. And even with all that, you still need a pilot who knows what they're doing. These aren't for joyrides, writer. These are for survival."
