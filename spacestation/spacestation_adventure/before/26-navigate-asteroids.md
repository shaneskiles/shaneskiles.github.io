"Navigating asteroid fields safely?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's not for the faint of heart, writer. You need a ship with good maneuverability, reinforced plating, and a pilot with nerves of steel. The Wires' tracking is useless in there, but so are most automated navigation systems. It's all about manual control, reading the currents, anticipating collisions. Some pilots even use the asteroids themselves as cover, bouncing off them, using their mass to obscure their signatures. It's a dance with death, but if you master it, you can go where the Wires can't follow."
