"Using currents for faster travel?" Wilkins grins. "You can use the currents to slingshot yourself, to gain massive speed without expending fuel. It's all about precision, about timing, about trusting your instincts. One wrong move, and you could be flung into the void, or crushed by the asteroid's gravity. But if you master it, you can go where the Wires can't follow, and where no automated system would dare. It's a dangerous dance, but if you master it, you can go where the Wires can't follow, and where no automated system would dare."
