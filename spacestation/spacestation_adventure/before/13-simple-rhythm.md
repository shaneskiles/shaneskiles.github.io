You tap a simple, repeating rhythm on the bulkhead. *Tap-tap-tap... tap-tap-tap...* The sound echoes in the profound silence of the observation deck, a small, deliberate noise in a world of quiet. You listen intently for any reply, any answering tap, any sign that your signal has been received. The tension in the room is palpable, as if the very air is holding its breath. You wonder if this is a language Roberts understands, or if it's just noise.
