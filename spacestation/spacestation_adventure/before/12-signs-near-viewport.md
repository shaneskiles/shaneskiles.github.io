You meticulously search for any signs of recent presence near the viewport. The dust is thick, but you look for scuff marks, faint outlines, or anything that suggests someone has been here recently. You run your hands along the floor and walls, feeling for any subtle indentations or disturbances. The silence of the room is profound, making you feel like an archaeologist uncovering ancient secrets. You wonder if Roberts, or another sleepwalker, has been here, leaving behind a subtle clue.
