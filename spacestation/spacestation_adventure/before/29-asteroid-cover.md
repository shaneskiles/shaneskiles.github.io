"Using asteroids for cover or evasion?" Wilkins grins. "It's an art form. You duck behind a large rock to break a sensor lock, or use its mass to obscure your signature. The Wires' tracking is useless in there, but so are most automated navigation systems. It's all about manual control, reading the currents, anticipating collisions. Some pilots even use the asteroids themselves as cover, bouncing off them, using their mass to obscure their signatures. It's a dance with death, but if you master it, you can go where the Wires can't follow."
