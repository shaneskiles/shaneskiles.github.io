"Using landmarks for navigation in the Tangle?" Wilkins nods. "It's a necessity. No two paths are the same, and it's constantly shifting as new sections are added or old ones break off. You navigate by unique structural landmarks: a salvaged freighter with a distinctive hull, a module with a flickering neon sign, a section with a peculiar hum. And by environmental cues: the smell of recycled air, the faint hum of ancient machinery, the subtle shifts in temperature. It's easy to get lost, and even easier to stumble into trouble. But if you know your way around, you can find hidden markets, secret docks, and places where the Wires' influence is completely absent."
