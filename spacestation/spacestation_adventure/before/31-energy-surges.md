"Unpredictable energy surges in the Veil Nebula?" Wilkins shakes his head. "They're caused by the chaotic interplay of gas, dust, and raw energy. Massive electromagnetic discharges, sudden bursts of radiation. They can fry your systems in an instant, overload your shields, even cause your ship to lose power. You need a ship with robust power regulation, and a pilot who can react instantly. It's a place where the laws of physics seem to bend, where the void itself is trying to kill you. You need a ship with reinforced plating, a powerful shield, and a pilot with nerves of steel. And even then, it's a gamble. A very dangerous gamble."
