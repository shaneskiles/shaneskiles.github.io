"Evading Wire retaliation?" Wilkins nods slowly. "It's a constant game of cat and mouse. You use their blind spots, the places where their network is thin or where old tech interferes with their signals. You move fast, you stay unpredictable. You disrupt their tracking systems, throw them off your scent. Sometimes, you even use their own network against them, feeding them false data, leading them on wild goose chases. It's a war of wits, writer. And the Wires have infinite resources, but you have something they don't: ingenuity. And the element of surprise."
