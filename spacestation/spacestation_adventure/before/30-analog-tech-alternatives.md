"Alternative ways to acquire analog tech?" Wilkins nods. "Credits aren't always king out here. You can trade goods, services, even information. A rare mineral for an old comms unit, a piloting job for a manual navigation system. Or you can scavenge. The decommissioned sections of the station, the forgotten wrecks in asteroid fields. It's a long shot, and often dangerous, but you might find what you need. It's all about being resourceful, about thinking outside the Wires' network. That's how we survive out here."
