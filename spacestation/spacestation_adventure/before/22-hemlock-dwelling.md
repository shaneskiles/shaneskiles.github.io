You search for signs of recent activity or a dwelling in the Hydroponics Level. After a while, you spot a small, makeshift shelter tucked away amidst a particularly dense cluster of mutated plants. It's constructed from salvaged materials, and a faint, earthy smell emanates from it. You can see a few crude tools and a worn blanket near the entrance. It's clear someone lives here, or at least spends a lot of time here. You wonder if this is Old Man Hemlock's dwelling.
