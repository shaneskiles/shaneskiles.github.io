You decide to try and communicate with any potential hidden occupants, or perhaps even Roberts himself. You consider your options, knowing that any sound will echo in this silent chamber. You could call out, or try a more subtle approach. The idea of someone else being here, watching you from the shadows, sends a shiver down your spine, but your curiosity outweighs your apprehension. You want answers, and perhaps a direct approach is the only way to get them.
