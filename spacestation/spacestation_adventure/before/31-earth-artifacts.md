"Old Earth artifacts?" Wilkins grins, a glint in his eye. "Relics from before the Collapse, before the Wires took over. They're rare, and highly sought after by collectors. Anything from ancient tools to personal trinkets, even fragments of old books or art. They're a tangible link to a past the Wires want us to forget. They hold stories, histories, a sense of what humanity was before it was... optimized. They're valuable, not just for their rarity, but for what they represent: a time when humanity was truly free."
