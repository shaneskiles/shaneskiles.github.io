"Building an EMP device?" Wilkins raises an eyebrow. "That's a tall order, writer. You'd need specialized components: high-capacity capacitors, a powerful electromagnetic coil, a precise trigger mechanism. And the knowledge to put it all together without blowing yourself up. It's not something you learn from a datapad. It takes a real understanding of physics, of electronics, of how to bend the very fabric of energy to your will. Most people wouldn't even know where to start. But if you could pull it off, you'd have a powerful weapon against the Wires. A very dangerous weapon."
