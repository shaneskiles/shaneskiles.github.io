"Critical issues?" the young mechanic sighs, running a hand through his greasy hair. "The hull leaks are the worst. Small ones, mostly, but they add up. We're constantly losing air, and the pressure differentials are a nightmare. And the life support... it's barely holding on in some sections. Wilkins says it's a miracle the place is still in one piece. One major failure, and this whole station could become a tomb."
