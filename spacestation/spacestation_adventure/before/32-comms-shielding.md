"Shielding against interference for old comms?" Wilkins nods. "The Wires' chatter is everywhere, and it can easily disrupt a fragile analog signal. You need to shield your comms unit, create a Faraday cage around it. Use conductive materials, ground it properly, minimize any openings. It's a constant battle against the electromagnetic noise of the station. It's a lot of work, and it's never perfect. But every clear transmission, every uninterrupted conversation, is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
