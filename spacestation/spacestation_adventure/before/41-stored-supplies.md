"Stored supplies or resources in hidden rooms?" Wilkins shrugs. "Sometimes you get lucky. Stashes of non-perishable food, water, old-world batteries, even analog comms gear. Things people wanted to keep hidden from the Wires, or things they planned to use when they went off-grid. It's a testament to their foresight, their stubbornness. But it's rare, and usually in rough shape. You might find what you need, but you might also find nothing but dust and expired rations."
