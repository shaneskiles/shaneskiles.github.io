"Disrupting Wire tracking systems?" Wilkins nods. "That's where the real fun begins. You can use EMPs, of course, to temporarily blind them. But that's a blunt instrument, and it draws a lot of attention. A more subtle approach is to feed them false data, to lead them on wild goose chases. Corrupt their sensors, scramble their relays, make them chase ghosts. It's a war of wits, writer. And the Wires have infinite resources, but you have something they don't: ingenuity. And the element of surprise."
