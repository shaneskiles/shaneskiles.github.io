"Avoiding getting lost in the Tangle?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's a constant challenge. No official maps exist, and the Wires' sensors are useless in there. You can try to map it yourself, but it's constantly shifting. Your best bet is to rely on local guides, or to stick to the well-worn paths. But even then, it's easy to get disoriented. And getting lost in the Tangle can be fatal. You might stumble into a dangerous territory, or just run out of air. It's a place where only the resourceful survive."
