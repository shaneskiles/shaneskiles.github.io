"Those who disappeared on Haven?" Wilkins shakes his head, a somber look on his face. "No trace. Their comms went silent, their ships vanished. It's like they were erased from existence. Some say the Wires have a way of doing that, of making you truly disappear. Others think they just found a way to escape, to go somewhere the Wires can't reach. But I don't know. It's a mystery. And mysteries out here usually end badly. Haven is a ghost station now, a monument to defiance. The Wires don't forget, writer. And they don't forgive. They made an example of Haven, a warning to anyone who dares to challenge their control."
