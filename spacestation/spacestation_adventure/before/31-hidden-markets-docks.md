"Hidden markets and docks in the Tangle?" Wilkins nods. "They exist, but they're not marked on any map. You find them by reputation, by word of mouth. Places where independent traders gather, where you can find anything from rare minerals to forbidden data. The docks are usually small, makeshift affairs, designed for discretion, not volume. And the markets are chaotic, filled with the hum of old tech and the whispers of illicit deals. But they're also dangerous. You're relying on the trust of strangers, and trust is a rare commodity in the Tangle."
