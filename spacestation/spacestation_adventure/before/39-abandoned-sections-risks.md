"The risks of using abandoned sections?" Wilkins shakes his head. "They're not without their dangers. Unstable structures, corroded bulkheads, sudden depressurization. Environmental hazards like toxic gas pockets or radiation leaks. And sometimes, dormant automated defenses, old security systems that are still active, waiting for a trigger. You never know what you'll stumble upon in those forgotten corners. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the Wires don't patrol these areas, but that doesn't mean they're safe."
