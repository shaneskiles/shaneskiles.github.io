"The residential block?" Wilkins shakes his head. "Empty now. Just rows of dark, silent hab-units. Most folks left when the station started to decline. The Wires made it easy for 'em, offered incentives to move to the corporate stations. Said it was for their own good, for 'efficiency'. But some say it was a way to clear out the independent thinkers, the ones who preferred the freedom of Terrapin to the comfort of the Wires' cage. Whatever the reason, it's a ghost town now."
