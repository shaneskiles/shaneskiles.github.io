"Abandoned sections?" Wilkins shrugs. "Plenty of 'em. Medbay, old research labs, even a whole residential block. Just sealed 'em off when they became too much trouble to maintain, or when the Wires decided they weren't 'efficient' enough." He gestures vaguely. "Most of 'em are dark, cold. Nothing but dust and ghosts now. Some folks say there are still things hidden in there, things the Wires don't want found. But who's crazy enough to go looking?"
