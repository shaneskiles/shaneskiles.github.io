"News censorship?" Wilkins snorts. "They don't call it that, of course. They call it 'information optimization', 'maintaining public morale'. But it's censorship all the same. Any news that paints the Wires in a bad light, any reports of dissent, any mention of independent stations like Terrapin... it just disappears. Or it gets twisted, spun into something else entirely. They control the narrative, writer. They control what you see, what you hear, what you believe. It's a subtle cage, but it's a cage nonetheless."
