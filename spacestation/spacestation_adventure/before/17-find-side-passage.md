As you proceed deeper into the dark tunnel, your datapad's light catches a subtle opening in the wall â€“ a narrow side passage, almost completely obscured by hanging wires and debris. It's even darker than the main tunnel, and a faint, cold draft emanates from it. You wonder where it leads, and if it's a shortcut, a hidden route, or a trap. The silence of the tunnel is broken only by the drip of water and the scuttling of unseen things.
