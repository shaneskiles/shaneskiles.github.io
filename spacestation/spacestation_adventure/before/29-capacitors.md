"High-capacity capacitors?" Wilkins scratches his chin. "They're heavily regulated, used in power conduits and industrial machinery. You'd have to scavenge them from decommissioned sections of the station, or buy them on the black market, which is risky. They're the heart of any EMP device, storing the energy needed for the pulse. Without them, you're just holding a fancy paperweight. They're rare, and highly sought after by those who want to go off-grid. And the Wires keep a close eye on their distribution."
