"Old comms," Wilkins says, patting a dusty, ancient-looking radio on his counter. "They're not pretty, and they're not fast, but they're secure. No digital footprint, no Wire to intercept your signal. You have to tune them by hand, listen for the static, but that's the beauty of it. It's a direct line, person to person, without any digital middlemen. The range isn't great, and they can be finicky, but when you need to send a message that the Wires can't hear, there's nothing better. It's a dying art, operating these things, but a vital one."
