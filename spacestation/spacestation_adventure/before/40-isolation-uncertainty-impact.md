"The impact of isolation and uncertainty?" Wilkins sighs, a weary look in his eyes. "They cut you off, writer. They isolate you from your friends, your family, your support network. They spread false information, sow discord, turn people against each other. And the uncertainty... never knowing when the next crackdown will hit, when they'll cut off your supplies, when they'll come for you. It wears you down, makes you desperate. It's a psychological game as much as a physical one. And they're very, very good at it. They want to break your spirit, to make you believe that resistance is futile."
