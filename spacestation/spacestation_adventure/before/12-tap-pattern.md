You decide to tap a rhythmic pattern on the bulkhead, hoping to elicit a response. You choose a simple, repeating sequence, letting the sound resonate through the metal. The taps echo in the profound silence of the observation deck, a small, deliberate noise in a world of quiet. You listen intently for any reply, any answering tap, any sign that your signal has been received. The tension in the room is palpable, as if the very air is holding its breath.
