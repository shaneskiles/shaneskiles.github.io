"Roberts part of an alliance?" Wilkins laughs, a harsh, dry sound. "Not Roberts. He's a lone wolf, always has been. Trusts no one but himself, and maybe that little drone of his. He knows alliances are weak points, vulnerabilities the Wires can exploit. One compromised link, and the whole chain breaks. He prefers to operate in the shadows, unseen, unheard. That's how he's survived this long."
