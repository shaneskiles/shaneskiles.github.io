"The effect on different types of signals in the Veil Nebula?" Wilkins nods. "It scrambles them, distorts them, or just plain swallows them up. Digital signals are particularly vulnerable. The Wires' long-range comms just get lost in it. It's like trying to hear a whisper in a hurricane. Analog signals fare a bit better, but even they can be affected by the sheer amount of interference. It's a natural shield, a perfect place to disappear. But it's also full of unpredictable energy surges, and pockets of corrosive gas. One wrong move, and your ship could be torn apart, or your systems fried."
