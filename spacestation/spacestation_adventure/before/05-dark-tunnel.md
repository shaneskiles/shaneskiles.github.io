You venture into a particularly dark and ominous-looking maintenance tunnel. The air grows colder, and the faint hum of the station is replaced by the drip of condensation and the scuttling of unseen things. Your datapad's light barely penetrates the gloom, revealing only a few feet ahead. The walls are a tangle of exposed pipes and wires, and the floor is uneven, littered with debris. The darkness feels oppressive, and a sense of unease settles over you. This is clearly an area that has been long neglected.
