"Making abandoned sections habitable?" Wilkins sighs. "It's a massive undertaking, writer. You'd need to restore life support, purify the air, seal off any breaches. You'd need your own power source, your own water recycling. And then you'd need to secure the area, set up defenses against unwanted visitors, from the Wires or from other scavengers. It's a full-time job, a constant battle against entropy. But if you can pull it off, you'd have your own private sanctuary, a place where the Wires can't reach. It's a hard life, but a free one."
