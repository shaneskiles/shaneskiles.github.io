"Transition?" Wilkins spits the word out like a bad taste. "The Wires. That's the transition. They started building their own hubs, their own 'efficient' transit lanes. They made it harder and harder for independent stations like Terrapin to compete. They choked off the supply lines, diverted the traffic. They didn't destroy us directly, no. They just... starved us out. Most folks left, went to the corporate stations, became good little cogs. The ones who stayed... well, we're the stubborn ones. The ones who prefer to rot in freedom than thrive in a cage."
