"The development of paranoia?" Wilkins sighs, a weary look in his eyes. "It's a natural consequence of living under the Wires' thumb. You start to question everyone, everything. Is that person a Wire informant? Is this message being intercepted? Is this conversation being recorded? You censor your own thoughts, your own words, just in case they're listening. You become isolated, trusting no one. It's a psychological game as much as a physical one. And they're very, very good at it. They want to break your spirit, to make you believe that resistance is futile."
