You begin to examine the strange, mutated plants clinging to the walls and ceiling of the Hydroponics Level. Their forms are distorted, their colors unnatural, a testament to the harsh conditions and perhaps something more. You carefully touch a leaf, feeling its rough texture, and notice a faint, almost imperceptible glow from some of the larger specimens. The air is heavy with a sweet, cloying scent that you can't quite place. You wonder what caused these mutations, and if they hold any secrets.
