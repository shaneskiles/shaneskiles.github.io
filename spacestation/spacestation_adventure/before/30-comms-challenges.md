"Common challenges with old comms?" Wilkins sighs. "Static, interference, sudden breakdowns. The Wires' chatter is everywhere, and it can easily disrupt a fragile analog signal. You need to know how to filter out the noise, how to find the signal in the static. And when something breaks, you can't just call a tech. You have to fix it yourself, with whatever parts you can scavenge. It's a constant battle against entropy, against the decay of old tech. But every clear transmission, every uninterrupted conversation, is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
