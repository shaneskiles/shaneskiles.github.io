"The capabilities of standard security drones?" Wilkins shrugs. "They have basic sensors: visual, audio, some thermal. A limited range, mostly for local patrols. And usually non-lethal deterrents: sonic emitters, stun fields, sometimes a net launcher. They're mostly for show, designed to deter petty crime and keep the peace. They're easily avoided if you know what you're doing. But they're also the Wires' eyes and ears. They report everything back to the central network. So even if you disable one, the Wires will know you were there. It's a constant game of cat and mouse."
