You systematically check the wall seams in the darker corners of the observation deck. Your fingers trace the lines where metal plates meet, feeling for any give or subtle indentations. Most of the seams are tight and unyielding, but you notice a particularly wide or unusual seam near the floor, almost hidden by a layer of dust. The metal is cold and rough, and the silence of the room is absolute, amplifying every subtle sound. You wonder if this is a hidden access point, or just a structural anomaly.
