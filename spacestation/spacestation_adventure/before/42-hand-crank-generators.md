"Hand-crank generators and their efficiency?" Wilkins chuckles. "They're not for the faint of heart, writer. You'll work for every watt. They're slow, tedious, and require a lot of physical effort, but they're secure. No Wire can tap into them, no algorithm can control them. They're perfect for charging small devices, for powering a single light, for keeping your comms alive in a pinch. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
