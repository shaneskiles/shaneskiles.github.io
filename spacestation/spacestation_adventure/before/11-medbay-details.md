"The Medbay?" Wilkins shrugs. "Hasn't been opened in twenty years, maybe more. We're all our own doctors here now. If you get sick, you either get better, or you don't. Simple as that." He shakes his head. "Used to be a proper facility, state-of-the-art. But then the Wires decided it wasn't 'cost-effective' to maintain a full medical staff on a 'declining asset' like Terrapin. So they pulled the plug. Left it to rot. Just like everything else they don't deem 'efficient'."
