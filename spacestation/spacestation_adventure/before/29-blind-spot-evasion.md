"Using blind spots for evasion?" Wilkins nods slowly. "It's a constant game of cat and mouse. You use their blind spots, the places where their network is thin or where old tech interferes with their signals. On Terrapin, that means the decommissioned cargo bays, the abandoned medbay, places with heavy electromagnetic interference. Off-station, it's nebulae, asteroid fields, fringe habitats. You move fast, you stay unpredictable. You use the environment to your advantage, to break their line of sight, to scramble their sensors. It's a war of wits, writer. And the Wires have infinite resources, but you have something they don't: ingenuity. And the element of surprise."
