"Unsanctioned tech or forbidden data?" Wilkins leans in, his voice a low murmur. "Anything that operates outside the Wires' network, anything that gives you an edge. Old comms units, manual navigation systems, even rudimentary AI that predates the Wires' dominance. And forbidden data, information the Wires have suppressed. It could be anything from historical records to blueprints for forbidden technology. It's all valuable, all dangerous. And all worth risking your neck for, if you're brave enough."
