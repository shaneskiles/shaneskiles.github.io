"The resistance to Wire influence?" Wilkins nods. "These habitats are designed to resist. They have their own networks, their own ways of communicating, their own defenses. They use old-world tech, analog systems, anything that operates outside the Wires' network. They employ physical defenses, electromagnetic shielding, even some rudimentary jamming devices. It's a constant struggle, but they've managed to maintain their independence. It's a hard life, but a free one. And they're always looking for new ways to resist, new ways to stay off-grid."
