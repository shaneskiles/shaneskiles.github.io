You decide to apply pressure to suspicious areas on the walls, hoping to trigger a hidden mechanism. You press firmly on a section of the bulkhead that feels slightly different, or where the metal seems to give a little. The metal is cold and unyielding, and nothing happens. You try another spot, then another. The silence of the room is absolute, and you feel a growing sense of frustration. You wonder if you're missing something, or if there's no hidden panel here at all.
