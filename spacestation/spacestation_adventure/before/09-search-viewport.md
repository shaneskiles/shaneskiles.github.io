You focus your search on the main viewport area, running your hands along the smooth, cold plasteel. The view of the stars is mesmerizing, but you force yourself to concentrate on the task at hand. You check for seams, hidden buttons, or any irregularities in the frame. The silence of the room is absolute, making you hyper-aware of every subtle vibration and the faint hum of the station's distant machinery. You wonder if Roberts, or anyone else, might have left something behind here, a clue in this vast, silent space.
