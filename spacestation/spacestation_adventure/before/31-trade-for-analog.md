"Trading goods or services for analog tech?" Wilkins nods. "Credits aren't always king out here. You can trade goods, services, even information. A rare mineral for an old comms unit, a piloting job for a manual navigation system. It's all about what you have that they need. The fringe habitats operate on their own economy, and they value resourcefulness. But be careful. You're dealing with people who live outside the Wires' rules, and they can be ruthless. It's all about being resourceful, about thinking outside the Wires' network. That's how we survive out here."
