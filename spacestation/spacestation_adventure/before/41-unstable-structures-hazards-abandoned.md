"Unstable structures and environmental hazards in abandoned sections?" Wilkins shakes his head. "They're not without their dangers. Corroded bulkheads, sudden depressurization, collapsing floors. Toxic gas pockets, radiation leaks from old reactors. You never know what you'll stumble upon in those forgotten corners. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the Wires don't patrol these areas, but that doesn't mean they're safe. You need to be constantly aware of your surroundings, and ready for anything."
