"The types of manual control panels found on Terrapin?" Wilkins nods. "They're usually basic, mechanical interfaces. Levers, dials, physical buttons. Nothing digital, nothing the Wires can touch. They're designed for direct control, for a pilot who trusts their own hands over an algorithm. They're rare, and often in need of repair, but they offer a level of control and security that modern systems can't match. It's a dying art, operating these things, but a vital one."
