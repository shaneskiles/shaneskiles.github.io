"Links to old research labs?" Wilkins's voice drops to a whisper. "That's where the real secrets are buried. Experiments, data, things the Wires want to keep hidden. They were working on things that could change everything, things that could challenge the Wires' control. But something went wrong. Very wrong. The labs were sealed, and whatever was in there was left to rot. But some say, the data is still there, waiting to be found. It's a dangerous place, writer. And the truth can be a heavy burden."
