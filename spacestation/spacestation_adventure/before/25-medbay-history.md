"The medbay's history..." Wilkins's voice drops to a near whisper. "It's a dark chapter. The official story is a virulent plague, contained and eradicated. But there are whispers. Whispers of experiments, of attempts to 'optimize' human consciousness, to integrate us more fully with the Wires. Whatever happened, it went wrong. Very wrong. The Wires sealed it off, declared it a biohazard. No one goes in, no one comes out. Or so they say. But some believe there are still things in there, things that shouldn't be disturbed."
