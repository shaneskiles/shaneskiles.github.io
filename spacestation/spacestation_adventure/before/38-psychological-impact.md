"The psychological effect on inhabitants during a crackdown?" Wilkins shudders. "It's insidious, writer. The constant threat, the feeling of being watched, the uncertainty of when the next shoe will drop. It wears you down, makes you paranoid. You start to question everyone, everything. They spread false information, sow discord, turn people against each other. They want to break your spirit, to make you believe that resistance is futile. It's a psychological game as much as a physical one. And they're very, very good at it."
