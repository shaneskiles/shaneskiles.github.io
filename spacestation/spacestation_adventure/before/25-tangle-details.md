"The Tangle," Wilkins says, a glint of something akin to respect in his eyes. "It's not a station, not really. More like a living, breathing organism of salvaged ships, repurposed modules, and sheer human stubbornness. No central authority, no unified network. Everyone runs their own systems, often old and patched-together tech. It's a haven for those who want to stay off the grid, for those who've been burned by the Wires. But it's also dangerous. No rules, no oversight. You're on your own out there. And the Wires still send their probes, trying to map it, trying to find a way in."
