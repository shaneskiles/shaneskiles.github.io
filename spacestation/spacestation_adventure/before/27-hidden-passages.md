"Hidden passages in the medbay?" Wilkins nods slowly. "They're not on any official schematics. Maintenance tunnels, old ventilation shafts, even some emergency escape routes that were never properly sealed. They lead to other forgotten sections of the station, places the Wires don't monitor. Some say they even connect to the old research labs, where the real secrets are buried. But they're dark, cramped, and often unstable. And you never know what you'll find down there. Best to have a light, and a strong stomach."
