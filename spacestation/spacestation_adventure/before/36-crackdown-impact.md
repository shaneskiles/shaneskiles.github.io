"The immediate impact on station life during a crackdown?" Wilkins sighs, a grim look on his face. "They try to make life as difficult as possible. Non-essential power cut, comms jammed, even rationing of water and recycled air in some sectors. They want to squeeze you, to make you desperate enough to give up your secrets, or to betray your friends. It's a psychological game as much as a physical one. They want to break your spirit, to remind you that you're always under their thumb. It's a harsh lesson, writer. A very harsh lesson."
