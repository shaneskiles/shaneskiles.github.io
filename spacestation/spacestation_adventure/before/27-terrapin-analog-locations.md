"Specific locations on Terrapin for analog tech?" Wilkins scratches his beard. "The deeper, unmonitored sections are your best bet. The old cargo bays, especially Bay 7. Scavengers sometimes pull old comms units or manual control panels out of there. And the abandoned medbay, sealed off for decades. No active systems, just dust and forgotten equipment. It's rare, and usually in rough shape, but it's out there. You just have to be willing to dig through a lot of junk, and avoid the Wires' patrols."
