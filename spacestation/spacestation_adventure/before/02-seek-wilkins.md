You decide to seek out Wilkins, remembering the shuttle pilot's vague directions to the station's general store. The corridors are a labyrinth of patched bulkheads and flickering lights. The air is thin, carrying the faint scent of ozone and old metal. After several wrong turns, you spot a slightly brighter glow ahead and hear the faint clinking of tools. You push through a heavy, grimy curtain, revealing Wilkins's General Store & Workshop â€“ a chaotic haven of salvaged parts, questionable supplies, and the strong aroma of recycled coffee. Wilkins, a wiry man with shrewd eyes, looks up from a half-disassembled conduit, a young man with grease on his hands working quietly in the background.
