"Safe water storage?" Wilkins nods. "Sealed containers, anything that won't leak or contaminate. Old fuel cells, repurposed chemical drums, even heavy-duty plastic bladders. You need to protect your water supply from airborne contaminants, from radiation, from anything that could make it undrinkable. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
