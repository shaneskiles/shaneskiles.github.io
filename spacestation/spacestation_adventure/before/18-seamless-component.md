You pick up the unique, seamless component. It's a section of matte-black plating, unusually smooth and cold to the touch. There are no visible seams, no bolts, no obvious way it was manufactured or attached. It feels alien, unlike any technology you've encountered on Mars. You try to identify its function, but it offers no clues. You wonder if this is a piece of the *Lacuna*, Roberts's elusive ship, and what secrets its construction might hold.
