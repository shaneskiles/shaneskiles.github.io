You sift through the salvaged parts, specifically looking for anything that might be from the *Lacuna*. You find a small, intricate power conduit that doesn't match any known schematics, its design elegant and alien. It hums faintly when you hold it, a subtle vibration that suggests a hidden power source. You also spot a few other components that seem unusually smooth and seamless, similar to the matte-black plating you found earlier. Wilkins watches you from his counter, his expression unreadable. You wonder if these are indeed pieces of Roberts's elusive vessel, and what secrets they might hold.
