"Understanding stellar drift and patterns?" Wilkins nods. "The stars aren't static, writer. They move, they shift, they drift over time. You have to account for that in your navigation. It's a subtle change, but over long distances, it can throw you completely off course. It's a constant mental exercise, a dance with the void. Most pilots these days rely on the Wires' automation, but a true navigator trusts their own instincts. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
