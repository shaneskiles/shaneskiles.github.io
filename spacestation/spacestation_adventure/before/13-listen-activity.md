You pause, straining your ears for any sounds of activity beyond the station's constant hum. The silence is profound, but if you listen closely, you can discern subtle nuances. A faint, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* seems to echo from somewhere deep within the station's core, not part of the usual symphony of machinery. You also try to pick up any distant voices or conversations, hoping to pinpoint areas where people might be gathered. The station feels vast and empty, but you know there are others here.
