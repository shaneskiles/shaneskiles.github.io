"Other sealed-off areas?" Wilkins gestures vaguely. "There's the old research labs, full of dusty equipment and forgotten experiments. And a whole residential block, empty now, just rows of dark, silent hab-units. They're all just monuments to what used to be. Places the Wires deemed unnecessary. Or perhaps, places they didn't want anyone poking around in. You never know with them."
