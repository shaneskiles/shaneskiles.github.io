"Wire infiltration of the black market?" Wilkins nods grimly. "They're everywhere. They have their own informants, their own agents, even their own automated systems monitoring the black market. They'll let you make your deal, let you think you're safe, and then they'll swoop in. They don't care about the petty crimes; they care about anything that disrupts their control. And the black market is a prime source of such disruptions. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the house always wins."
