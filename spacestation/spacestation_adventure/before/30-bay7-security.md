"Security in Bay 7?" Wilkins chuckles. "It's more of a suggestion than a rule. The Wires don't bother with it much, too much old tech interfering with their sensors. You might see a stray security drone now and then, but they're easily avoided. Physical security is minimal, mostly old locks and rusted gates. The real security is the reputation of the place. Everyone knows it's a place for illicit dealings, and those who operate there tend to be... self-reliant. They don't need the Wires to keep order. They have their own ways."
