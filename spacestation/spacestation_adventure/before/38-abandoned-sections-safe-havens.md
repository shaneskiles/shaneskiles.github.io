"Using abandoned sections as safe havens?" Wilkins nods. "They're perfect for disappearing. No active systems, no Wire chatter, just dust and ghosts. The old cargo bays, the decommissioned residential blocks, even the abandoned medbay. But they're not without their dangers. Unstable structures, environmental hazards, even dormant automated defenses. And you'll need to bring your own supplies, your own power, your own air. It's a hard life, but a free one. And the Wires don't bother with them much, which makes them ideal for those who want to stay off-grid."
