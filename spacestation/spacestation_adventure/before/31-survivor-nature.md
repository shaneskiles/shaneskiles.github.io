"The nature of these rumored survivors?" Wilkins scoffs. "If anyone survived, they wouldn't be the same. The Wires made sure of that. Some say they became... sleepwalkers, like Roberts. Others say they were just broken. Mumbling about voices, about the Wires, about things they shouldn't have seen. They were no longer fully human, no longer fully connected. They were something else, something that existed on the fringes, between the network and the void. Whatever the truth, the Wires don't want anyone looking too closely. They want that medbay forgotten."
