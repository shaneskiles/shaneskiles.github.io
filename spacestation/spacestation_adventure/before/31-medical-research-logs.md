"Medical records or research notes?" Wilkins's eyes gleam with a hint of avarice. "Oh, there's plenty of that. Patient files, experimental data, even theories about the Wires' influence on human biology. Information the Wires deemed irrelevant, or dangerous. It's usually stored on old, unencrypted drives, or even physical data chips. But accessing it is another matter. Most of the old systems are dead, or require specialized knowledge to reactivate. And even if you get it, who knows what you'll find? The truth can be a heavy burden, writer. A very heavy burden."
