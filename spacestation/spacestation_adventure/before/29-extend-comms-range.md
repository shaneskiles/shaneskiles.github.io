"Extending the range of old comms?" Wilkins scratches his beard. "It's a challenge. You can use signal boosters, but they're rare and draw attention. Or set up relays, but that requires a network of trusted contacts. And optimizing your antenna configuration, that's a science in itself. It's a constant battle against the limitations of analog tech. But every extra light-year you can squeeze out of it is a victory against the Wires. It's a lifeline, but a fragile one."
