"Learning basic electronics and circuitry?" Wilkins shrugs. "It's not something the Wires teach anymore. They want you to rely on their systems, not your own ingenuity. You'd have to find old manuals, scavenge for parts, and learn by doing. It's about understanding how power flows, how circuits work, how to connect components. It's the foundation of any independent tech, any device that operates outside the Wires' network. It's a dying art, but a vital one for those who seek true freedom."
