You approach the small, locked display case near the counter. The glass is thick and dusty, obscuring the contents, but you can make out the faint outlines of what appear to be data chips, or perhaps old, valuable components. The lock is a simple mechanical one, but it looks sturdy. Wilkins watches you from his counter, his expression unreadable. You wonder what secrets this case holds, and if it's worth the risk of trying to open it.
