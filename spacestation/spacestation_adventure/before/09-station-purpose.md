"Original purpose?" Wilkins scoffs, a bitter edge to his voice. "Terrapin was built as a gateway, a jumping-off point for the outer colonies. A place where independent traders, prospectors, and even a few dreamers could resupply and refuel before heading into the deep dark. It was a place of opportunity, of freedom. Before the Wires decided everything needed to be... centralized. Controlled." He spits on the floor, a rare display of open contempt. "They called it progress. We called it a cage."
