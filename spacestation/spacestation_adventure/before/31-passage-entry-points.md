"Specific entry points to these passages?" Wilkins leans in, his voice a low murmur. "They're not on any official schematics. Hidden behind false panels, disguised as maintenance access points, even some old ventilation shafts that were never properly sealed. You have to know what you're looking for, and you have to be willing to get your hands dirty. They're mostly in the older, decommissioned sections of the station, places the Wires don't bother to monitor closely. But they're dark, cramped, and often unstable. And you never know what you'll find down there."
