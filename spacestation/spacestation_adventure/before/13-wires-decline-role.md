"The Wires' role?" Wilkins spits on the floor. "They didn't need to send fleets, writer. They just needed to control the flow. They built their own transit hubs, their own supply chains, their own 'efficient' networks. They made it so expensive, so difficult, to operate outside their system that most folks just gave up. They choked us off, slowly, deliberately. They didn't destroy us directly, no. They just... made us irrelevant. And then they waited for us to rot."
