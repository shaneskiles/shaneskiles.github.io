You focus on the faint, rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* echoing from somewhere deep within the station's core. It's not part of the usual symphony of machinery, and it sounds deliberate, almost like a heartbeat. The sound is subtle, but persistent, drawing you in. You wonder what could be making such a noise in this quiet, decaying station. Is it a malfunction, a hidden operation, or something else entirely?
