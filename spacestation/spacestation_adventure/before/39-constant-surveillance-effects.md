"The effects of constant surveillance?" Wilkins shudders. "It's insidious, writer. The feeling of being watched, of never truly being alone. Every comms burst, every data packet, every energy signature... they're building a profile on you. It wears you down, makes you paranoid. You start to question everyone, everything. You censor your own thoughts, your own words, just in case they're listening. It's a cage without bars, a prison of the mind. And it's very, very effective."
