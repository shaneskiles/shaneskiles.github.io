"Last used?" Wilkins scoffs. "Before my time, mostly. Heard stories. Some kind of plague, or a bad batch of recycled air. Whatever it was, it hit hard. The Wires decided it wasn't worth the resources to contain it here. So they just... sealed it off. Left everyone inside to their fate. 'Efficient', they called it. I call it murder. That's why we're our own doctors now. Can't trust the Wires with your life."
