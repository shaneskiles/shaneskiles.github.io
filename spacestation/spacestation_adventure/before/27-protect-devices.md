"Protecting your devices from EMPs?" Wilkins shakes his head. "It's a gamble. A Faraday cage can help, a shielded box that blocks electromagnetic fields. But it has to be perfect, no gaps, no weak points. And even then, a strong enough pulse can still get through. Or you can disconnect them from power, remove their batteries. But that means they're useless during the EMP. It's a trade-off, writer. You either risk your tech, or you go dark. There's no foolproof way to protect everything when you're playing with that kind of power."
