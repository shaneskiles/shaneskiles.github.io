"The difficulty of finding these passages?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're not easy to find. You need to know what you're looking for, and you need to be willing to get your hands dirty. They're often hidden in plain sight, disguised as something else. And even if you find an entry point, the passages themselves are dark, cramped, and often unstable. You could get lost, or trapped, or worse. And the Wires don't patrol these areas, but that doesn't mean they're safe. You never know what you'll find down there."
