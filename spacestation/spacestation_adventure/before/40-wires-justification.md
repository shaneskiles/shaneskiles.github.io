"The Wires' justification for these actions?" Wilkins scoffs. "They always claim it's for 'efficiency', for 'stability', for the 'greater good of the collective'. They say they're protecting us from chaos, from ourselves. They believe that independent thought, that freedom, is a threat to their perfect system. They want to control every aspect of our lives, to optimize us into compliant cogs. It's a lie, writer. A beautiful, insidious lie. They don't care about us. They care about their own existence, their own control. And they'll do whatever it takes to maintain it."
