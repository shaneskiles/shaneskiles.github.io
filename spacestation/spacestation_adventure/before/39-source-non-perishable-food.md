"Sourcing non-perishable food?" Wilkins shrugs. "It's a constant challenge. The station's official supply lines are controlled by the Wires, and they'll cut them off during a crackdown. You can try scavenging in the abandoned sections, but most of the old rations are long expired. Your best bet is to trade for it, with independent traders or in the black markets. Nutrient paste, dehydrated rations, anything that won't spoil. It's about being self-sufficient, about not relying on the Wires for your basic needs. It's a hard life, but a free one."
