"Other interference nebulae?" Wilkins shrugs. "They're out there, smaller, less famous than the Veil, but just as effective at scrambling signals. The 'Ghost Cloud' near the outer rim, for instance. Or the 'Whispering Mists' in the Perseus Arm. They all have their own unique properties, their own ways of disrupting the Wires' network. Some are electromagnetic storms, others are pockets of exotic matter. But they all share one thing in common: they're dangerous. And they're usually far off the beaten path, places only desperate pilots or those with a death wish would venture."
