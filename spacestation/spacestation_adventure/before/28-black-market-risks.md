"The risks of black market dealings?" Wilkins shakes his head slowly. "Where do I begin? Scams, traps, double-crosses. Most of the sellers are unreliable, and some are outright dangerous. You might get a faulty device, or worse, get ambushed and robbed. And the Wires are always watching. They have their own informants, their own agents, even their own automated systems monitoring the black market. They'll let you make your deal, let you think you're safe, and then they'll swoop in. It's a dangerous game, writer. And the house always wins."
