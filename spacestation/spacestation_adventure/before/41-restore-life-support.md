"Restoring life support and air quality in abandoned sections?" Wilkins sighs. "It's a massive undertaking, writer. You'd need to purify the air, seal off any breaches in the hull, reactivate old ventilation systems. You'd need your own power source, your own water recycling. It's a constant battle against entropy, a full-time job. But if you can pull it off, you'd have your own private sanctuary, a place where the Wires can't reach. It's a hard life, but a free one."
