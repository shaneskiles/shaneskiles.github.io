"Valuable cargo, eh?" Wilkins grins, a glint in his eye. "That's what everyone's after. Old Earth artifacts, pre-Collapse tech, rare minerals, even data chips with suppressed information. Anything that the Wires don't want you to have, or that can give you an edge. It's usually hidden deep in the decommissioned bays, or smuggled in by independent traders. But it comes with a price. Not just credits, but risk. The Wires keep a close eye on anything that could disrupt their control, and valuable cargo often falls into that category."
