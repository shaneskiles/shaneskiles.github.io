You meticulously search for any hidden compartments or override panels around the viewport. You run your hands along the seams, feeling for any give or subtle indentations. The plasteel is smooth and cold, offering no obvious clues. You wonder if the mechanism is truly hidden, or if it requires a specific sequence of actions to reveal itself. The silence of the room is absolute, making you hyper-aware of every subtle texture and temperature change.
