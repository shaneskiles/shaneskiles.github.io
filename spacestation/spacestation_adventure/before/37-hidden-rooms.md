"Specific hidden rooms or compartments?" Wilkins grins. "They're not on any schematics, writer. These are places built by the old-timers, by those who valued privacy and secrecy above all else. False walls, disguised panels, even old ventilation shafts repurposed as living spaces. You have to know what you're looking for, and you have to be willing to get your hands dirty. They're usually small, cramped, and often uncomfortable, but they offer a level of security that the Wires can't penetrate. A true safe haven, if you can find one."
