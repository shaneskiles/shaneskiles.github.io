You decide to wait for a longer period in the observation deck, hoping that sheer persistence will eventually draw out Roberts. The silence deepens, and the vastness of the void outside becomes even more profound. You feel the subtle shifts in the station's structure, the faint hum of distant machinery, but no other signs of life. Your patience is tested, and you begin to question if this is a futile endeavor. Is Roberts truly here, or are you simply waiting for a ghost?
