You awaken to the low, omnipresent hum of Terrapin Station, a sound that now feels less like a lullaby and more like the laughter of a cage. Memories are slippery, like smoke. A seamless, black ship. A silent man. A talking sphere. Were they real? Or was it all a program, a simulation? Your datapad is blank, wiped clean. The distinction between reality and illusion has ceased to matter. You are on Terrapin Station, a tomb of rust and whispers, and a crushing certainty settles in: you are the dream of the 20-watt sleepwalker, and you are finally, truly, awake.
