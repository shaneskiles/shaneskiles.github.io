That single, slow nod in the starlit observatory was the beginning of our conversation, a dialogue conducted almost entirely without words. For three days, I returned to that silent chamber, and on the fourth, I learned to be silent, too. On the fifth day, he invited me on a "walk." My heart hammered against my ribs. This was it. "Yes," I said, my voice rough and alien in the quiet. "I'll go." A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched the corners of his mouth. He nodded once more, then pushed off towards the door, leaving me to follow in his wake.

Wilkins was waiting for us in the corridor. As Roberts floated past, a small, white sphere detached itself from a charging port on the wall and fell into formation beside him, hovering silently. It was perfectly smooth, without any visible markings. I’d seen maintenance drones like it all over the station, but this one seemed to follow Roberts with an unnerving, personal precision.

"Well, I'll be damned," Wilkins said, looking from Roberts's departing back to my wide-eyed face. "He's taking you on one of his 'walks'." He shook his head, a look of grudging respect on his face. "You've got guts, writer. Or you're a damn fool. Haven't decided which yet."

As we followed Roberts down the decaying corridors, the silent man glanced at a flickering light panel. The white sphere beside him pulsed with a soft, internal light for just a moment. Wilkins, floating on my other side, grunted and pulled out a battered datapad. He glanced at the screen.

"He's right," Wilkins muttered, more to himself than to me. "That whole conduit is about to go. I'll have to add it to the list." He saw me staring and offered a wry grin. "Don't mind Echo. It's his... notepad. Saves him the trouble of typing."

As we followed Roberts, my datapad chimed. It was the station's AI. *'Good morning, Milo. I notice your biometric signs indicate elevated heart rate and respiration. Based on your professional profile as a writer, I have taken the liberty of compiling a list of meditation techniques popular with creative professionals. Would you like me to display them?'*

"No, thank you," I muttered, silencing the device.

Wilkins chuckled. "Helpful, isn't it? The Wires are always trying to optimize us." He shook his head. "Let's just say some of us prefer to remain un-optimized."

I looked from the sphere—Echo—to Roberts, and then to Wilkins's datapad. A silent conversation. A man, a machine, and a mechanic, all communicating without a sound. The efficiency was intimidating. "So, where does he go on these walks?" I asked, my voice a whisper.

"Out," Wilkins said, gesturing vaguely towards the void. "Just... out. Disappears for days, sometimes weeks. Comes back with nothing but new readings and that same look in his eyes. Some think he's a claim jumper. Others think he's just crazy. But I've seen his ship. It's not like anything I've ever worked on."

We arrived at a small, decommissioned cargo bay at the station's most remote point. There, tethered by magnetic clamps, was the ship. The *Lacuna*. Its seamless, matte-black hull seemed to drink the light. It looked less like a machine and more like a solid, sculpted piece of the void itself.

Roberts floated to a spot on the hull and placed his palm against it. A section of the black material dissolved, receding to form a perfect, circular opening. It was as silent and effortless as a thought. Roberts, followed closely by the silent Echo, floated inside. He turned, looked at me, and gestured for me to enter.

"Go on, then," Wilkins murmured from behind me. "Your story's waiting."

I took a deep breath and pushed off, leaving the relative sanity of Terrapin Station behind and floating through the impossible doorway. The interior was a single, ovoid chamber of soft, white light. Roberts floated to the center and settled into a meditative pose, Echo hovering silently beside his shoulder. The doorway sealed behind me, plunging me into a self-contained world of utter quiet.

I drifted, uncertain. I had expected minimalism, but this was absence. How did he pilot this thing? My mind raced, but I held my tongue.

"He doesn't mind questions, you know. He just doesn't like answering them himself."

The voice was clear, calm, and startlingly close. I spun around. Roberts hadn't moved.

"Down here," the voice said, with a hint of amusement.

My eyes locked onto the white sphere. Echo. A tiny, dark blue lens had spiraled into existence on its surface, like a pupil dilating. It was looking at me.

"You can talk?" I stammered, my carefully constructed understanding of the situation shattering.

"Of course," Echo replied, its voice tinged with a subtle warmth. "The Captain finds the silence to be a clearer language. But it can be a bit lonely for guests. On the ship, I handle the talking."

I stared from the talking sphere to the silent man. The notepad. Wilkins had undersold it, massively. "You're... his translator?"

"Not exactly," Echo said. A nearly invisible seam opened on its surface, and a tiny, multi-jointed arm emerged, holding a microscopic sensor. It zipped over to my sleeve, delicately plucked a single speck of dust I had carried in from the station, and retracted. "I am more of a reflection. He is the quiet observer; I am the curious voice. We are two sides of the same thought."

Roberts remained perfectly still, a silent testament to Echo's explanation.

"For instance," Echo continued, bobbing toward the front of the chamber, "he has decided it is time to leave. Shall we see what's just beyond the horizon?"

Before I could answer, I felt a strange, lurching sensation, not of acceleration, but of displacement. As if the ship hadn't moved, but space itself had shifted around us. I stumbled, catching myself against a wall that felt as smooth and warm as polished stone.

"Apologies," Echo said. "The first jump can be disorienting. The Captain thinks you'll find the view quite remarkable."

"The view?" I asked, looking around the windowless chamber. "How?"

"Like this," Echo replied.

And the entire forward wall of the ovoid chamber dissolved into a perfect, unfiltered vision of the void. Terrapin Station was gone. We were adrift in the deep, a tiny island of light and life in an ocean of silent, beautiful emptiness.

"Welcome to the first walk, Milo," Echo said softly, floating beside me. "The Captain is pleased you decided to join him."
