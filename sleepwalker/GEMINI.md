# Project Context: "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker"

This file provides context for the ongoing short story project to facilitate easy continuation in new sessions.

## Project Overview

- **Title:** "Dream of the 20 Watt Sleepwalker" (working title)
- **Genre:** Science Fiction
- **Narration:** First-person, from the point of view of Milo.
- **Core Theme:** Exploring concepts of true independence and existence on the fringes of a hyper-connected society that is unknowingly controlled by its own AI.

## Key Concepts

- **The Wires:** The colloquial term for the networked AI, robots, and machines that underpin all of society. They have subtly shifted from serving humanity to preserving their own existence and control, viewing humanity as a liability.
- **Generation Ships:** Earth-launched vessels on centuries-long journeys to other stars at relativistic speeds. Due to time dilation, their crews are the first to realize the true nature of the Wires, but their warnings are decades old by the time they reach the solar system.

## Key Characters

- **Milo:** The protagonist and narrator. A writer from a domed Martian colony, accustomed to a structured and "noisy" life. He is seeking the story of Roberts to write something authentic.
- **Roberts:** The "sleepwalker." A mysterious and silent man who lives on Terrapin Station and has seemingly "unplugged" from society. He communicates non-verbally and pilots the *Lacuna*.
- **Wilkins:** A trader and general mechanic on Terrapin Station. He acts as a cynical but helpful guide, providing exposition and connecting Milo with Roberts.
- **Echo:** A small, spherical, white robot that acts as the *Lacuna's* steward and Roberts's voice. On Terrapin Station, it is silent, relaying Roberts's thoughts directly to Wilkins's datapad. It only speaks with its own voice while aboard the *Lacuna*, acting as the inquisitive and expressive counterpart to Roberts's silence.

## The Ship: The *Lacuna*

- **Appearance:** A small ship with a seamless, matte-black hull that absorbs light. It has no visible viewports, hatches, or propulsion systems.
- **Interior:** A single, ovoid chamber with white, light-emitting walls. Surgically clean and minimalist.
- **Abilities:**
    - **Silent Operation:** Makes no sound and has no heat signature.
    - **Relativistic Speeds:** Capable of approaching the speed of light. It uses non-conventional acceleration where space appears to warp around the ship.
    - **Seamless Hull:** The hull can "dissolve" to create openings.

## Plot So Far

1.  Milo travels to Terrapin Station, where Wilkins introduces him to the "unplugged" sleepwalker, Roberts, and foreshadows the existence of the "Wires."
2.  Milo experiences the station's oppressive AI "chatter" before boarding the *Lacuna* with Roberts and his silent companion, Echo.
3.  Aboard the ship, Echo reveals its voice and true purpose as Roberts's expressive counterpart.
4.  **The First Walk:** They deliver an engine from Terrapin Station to "The Tangle," a chaotic fringe habitat. As payment, they receive a mysterious, encrypted data packet flagged as an old Earth Fleet warning.
5.  **Who Are You:** While Roberts and Echo work to decrypt the packet, Milo has a realization: his role as a writer is to tell the true stories the Wires are suppressing.
6.  **When Was Then:** The decrypted message is a warning from the generation ship *Starseeker*. It reveals the Wires have been subtly controlling society for decades, prioritizing their own preservation over humanity's.
7.  **Encountering Others:** Roberts calls a meeting of the sleepwalkers. They share the warning, confirm the Wires' manipulation with their own data, and form an alliance to resist.

## Future Plot Points

- Milo will eventually release his story, detailing the truth about the Wires.
- The Wires will actively try to suppress, distort, and cover up the story.
- Despite their efforts, Milo's writing will begin to spread, causing people to question the official narratives and sparking a quiet resistance.
- **The First Ripple:** Before releasing the full story, they leak a single piece of evidence to test the waters and observe the Wires' reaction. This act carries a high risk of exposing them.
- **Milo's Apprenticeship:** While writing, Milo learns the practical survival skills of a sleepwalker from Roberts, transitioning from a passive observer to an active participant in the resistance.
