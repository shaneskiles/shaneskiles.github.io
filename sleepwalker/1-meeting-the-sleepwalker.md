The shuttle from the Phobos transit hub was little more than a tin can, a relic of a bygone era of Martian colonization that prioritized function over any semblance of comfort. For me, a writer whose entire life had been spent in the climate-controlled, recycled air of the domed colonies, the journey was a necessary torment. I was chasing a ghost, a whisper in the data streams about a man named Roberts, a "sleepwalker." The story had become an obsession, a potential masterpiece that promised an escape from the formulaic corporate-sponsored narratives I was usually paid to write. This was a story of true independence, a concept so alien to my life in the rigidly structured Martian society that it felt like a myth.

My destination, Terrapin Station, was a forgotten pinprick in areostationary orbit, a place spoken of in hushed tones as a final stop for those who wished to truly disappear. The journey itself was a lesson in letting go. The rattling of the hull, the groans of stressed metal, and the unnerving silence between course corrections were a constant reminder of the thin, fragile barrier between my life and the absolute zero of the void. It was a stripping away of the artificial safeties of the colony, a baptism in the raw reality of space, and it was terrifyingly exhilarating. I clutched my datapad, the screen blank, knowing that the story I sought couldn't be found in research, but only in experience.

The station's automated airlock hissed open with a weary sigh, revealing a world bathed in the dim, red glow of emergency lighting. I pushed off from the hatch and floated into the main corridor, a disorienting transition into a realm of silence and decay. The air was thin, tasting of ozone and old metal. The low, constant hum of life support was the only sound, a stark contrast to the cacophony of the Martian cities. This was a place that had been forgotten by its creators, left to slowly crumble in the eternal twilight of orbit. Patched bulkheads and exposed wiring were everywhere, a testament to decades of ad-hoc repairs.

I felt like an intruder, a loud, clumsy creature from another world. My movements, accustomed to the simulated gravity of the colony, were graceless and excessive. I bumped into a conduit, sending a shiver through a nearby panel that caused the lights to flicker. The few faces I saw were gaunt and pale, their eyes carrying the distant look of people who spent more time looking out at the stars than at each other. They moved with a slow, deliberate grace, conserving every motion, every breath. Their silence was a wall, their glances fleeting and suspicious.

"Lost, or just sightseeing?" The voice, startlingly loud in the quiet, came from a side passage. A man floated into the main corridor, his movements practiced and efficient. He was wiry, with a shrewd, weathered face and eyes that seemed to miss nothing. He wore a patched-up jumpsuit littered with pockets, and a tool belt bristled with various gadgets.

"A bit of both, I suppose," I admitted, trying to steady myself against a handhold. "My name is Milo."

"Wilkins," he said, offering a curt nod. "I'm the closest thing this rust bucket has to a welcome wagon. And a general store. And a mechanic. You need parts, information, or a decent cup of recycled coffee, I'm your man. Information costs extra." He sized me up, his gaze lingering on my clean, colony-issued clothes. "You don't look like you're here to retire. You're either running from something, or you're looking for something. Given you came here, I'm betting on the latter."

"I'm a writer," I said. "I'm looking for a man named Roberts."

Wilkins' expression didn't change, but a flicker of something—amusement, perhaps—danced in his eyes. "A writer. Well, I'll be. We don't get many of your kind out here. Too quiet for most. As for Roberts... you're not the first to ask. He's become something of a local legend. The man who truly unplugged. Not just from the data streams, but from the Wires themselves." He tapped a nearby conduit. "Thinks they're always listening." Wilkins leaned in conspiratorially. "And they are. So we try not to give them anything worth hearing." He paused, looking me over again. "Why him?"

"I want to understand his story," I said simply. "Why he chose this."

"Chose it?" Wilkins let out a dry chuckle. "That's one way to put it. Most of us end up here because there's nowhere else to go. Roberts... he's different. He came here with a purpose. He wasn't running from the worlds, he was running *to* the silence." He gestured for me to follow him. "Alright, writer. I'll take you to him. Can't promise he'll talk to you. He doesn't talk to anyone. But I can get you in the same room. The rest is up to you."

I followed Wilkins through the station's labyrinthine passages. It was a journey deeper into the heart of decay and solitude. He moved with an easy familiarity, pointing out landmarks that were invisible to my untrained eye. "That's where old man Hemlock tried to grow potatoes," he said, pointing to a darkened alcove filled with withered vines. "And here," he tapped a sealed hatch, "is the 'medbay.' Hasn't been opened in twenty years. We're all our own doctors here."

His commentary painted a vivid picture of life on the station, a community of forgotten souls clinging to existence on the edge of the void. They were the castaways of the solar system, the ones who had fallen through the cracks of corporate ambition and colonial expansion. They weren't just surviving; they had created their own society, with its own rules and its own legends. And Roberts was their ultimate myth.

"We're here," Wilkins said, stopping before a heavy door labeled 'OBSERVATORY'. "He likes the view." He gave me a final, appraising look. "Don't expect much. The man's more star than human these days." He didn't knock, but simply pushed the unlatched door open, revealing a chamber of absolute darkness. He gave me a slight push, and I floated inside. The door hissed shut behind me, leaving me in silence.

The only light came from the breathtaking panorama of the star-dusted void. The view was overwhelming, a wall of silent, glittering infinity that seemed to pull the very thoughts from my mind. It was a temple to emptiness, and floating in its center, as if in prayer, was a figure. It was Roberts, silhouetted against the Milky Way, his body perfectly still, his limbs loose in the zero-gravity. He wore a patched, skeletal environment suit, stripped of all non-essential components. He was a study in stillness, a man so at one with his environment that he seemed less a person and more a part of the celestial mechanics.

I drifted into the room, my heart pounding. I didn't speak, sensing that words, the tools of my trade, were a currency without value here. They were a form of noise, and this was a place of profound quiet. For a long time, we simply floated in the shared darkness, two specks of life in an impossibly vast emptiness, the writer and his myth. I felt the frantic energy of my own world, the deadlines, the ambitions, the noise, all of it dissolving in the face of this absolute tranquility.

Then, with a slowness that seemed to stretch for an eternity, Roberts turned his head. His eyes, adjusted to the deep dark, were like pools of liquid night, reflecting the distant starlight. There was no surprise in them, no fear, only a calm, quiet recognition, as if he had been expecting me all along. He offered a slow, almost imperceptible nod, a silent greeting from one solitary soul to another. And in that gesture, I felt the beginning of my story, a fleeting connection in the silent, expansive dream of the sleepwalker.
