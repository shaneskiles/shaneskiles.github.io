So, I'm a writer, and I was living in one of those fancy domed colonies on Mars. Honestly, I was sick of churning out fluff pieces for corporations. I wanted a real story. I'd heard whispers about this guy, Roberts, a so-called "sleepwalker," and I got a little obsessed. His story was about real independence, something we didn't have back in our super-structured society on Mars.

I had to go to this place called Terrapin Station to find him. It was a forgotten little speck in orbit, a place people went to disappear. The shuttle ride was rough, just an old tin can rattling through space. It was scary, but also kind of a rush. I knew I wouldn't find this story by researching it; I had to live it.

The station was a dump. It was dark, quiet, and smelled like old metal and ozone. I felt like a tourist, clumsy and loud. The few people I saw looked like ghosts. They were pale, quiet, and moved with this slow, careful grace.

Then this guy, Wilkins, shows up. "Lost, or just sightseeing?" he asks. He was the station's handyman, shop owner, and general welcome wagon. He took one look at my clean clothes and knew I wasn't there to retire.

"I'm a writer," I told him. "I'm looking for Roberts."

Wilkins found that pretty funny. He said Roberts was a bit of a legend, the guy who'd totally unplugged from the Wiresâ€”the AI network that basically ran everything. "He thinks they're always listening," Wilkins whispered. "And they are."

I told him I just wanted to hear Roberts's story. Wilkins chuckled. "Most of us are here 'cause we've got nowhere else to go. Roberts, he came here for the silence." He agreed to take me to him but said not to expect a chat. "He doesn't talk to anyone."

He led me through a maze of hallways to the observatory. "He likes the view," Wilkins said, then shoved me into a pitch-black room.

The only light was from the insane view of the stars. And there, floating in the middle of it all, was Roberts. He was just hanging there in a beat-up old space suit, perfectly still.

I didn't say a word. It felt like a place where words didn't matter. We just floated there in the dark for a while. It was peaceful. Then, he turned his head and looked right at me. He didn't look surprised, just... like he was expecting me. He gave me this tiny little nod. And that's how my story started.

We had a sort of silent conversation for the next few days. I'd just go and hang out with him in the observatory. On the fifth day, he invited me on a "walk." My heart was pounding. "Yes," I said. "I'll go."

Wilkins was waiting for us when we left. A little white ball, a robot, detached from the wall and started following Roberts. "Well, I'll be damned," Wilkins said. "He's taking you on one of his 'walks'. You're either brave or an idiot."

He told me the sphere was named Echo, and it was like Roberts's notepad. As we were walking, my datapad buzzed. The station AI wanted to offer me meditation tips. I told it no thanks. Wilkins just laughed. "The Wires are always trying to 'help'," he said.

We got to an old cargo bay, and there was his ship, the *Lacuna*. It was just a smooth, black shape that seemed to suck in the light. A door just sort of... dissolved open. Roberts and Echo went in, and he waved me in after them.

The inside was just one big, white, egg-shaped room. Roberts floated to the middle and closed his eyes. The door sealed, and it was dead quiet. I had no idea how he flew this thing.

"He doesn't mind questions, you know," a voice said. "He just doesn't like answering them himself."

I whipped around. Roberts hadn't moved.

"Down here," the voice said. It was Echo. A little blue lens had opened up on its surface.

"You can talk?" I stammered. My whole idea of what was going on just fell apart.

"Of course," Echo said. "The Captain likes the quiet. I do the talking on the ship."

"So you're his translator?" I asked.

"Not really," Echo said. "More like two sides of the same coin. He's the quiet observer, I'm the curious voice."

Then the ship moved. It wasn't like normal acceleration; it was like space just bent around us. The front wall turned into a window with a perfect view of space. The station was gone.

"Welcome to the first walk, Milo," Echo said. "The Captain's glad you came."

Our first job was just a delivery. We were taking an engine to a place called 'The Tangle.' "The job itself is boring," Echo said. "It's the trip that matters."

The ship's hull flowed and reshaped itself to carry the engine on the outside. It was a long, quiet trip. Roberts just meditated. It was a whole different world out here, a network of people who operated outside the system.

The Tangle was a huge, messy collection of old ships and asteroids all strapped together. We dropped off the engine without saying a word. Our payment was a single, encrypted data file. A little red light blinked on Echo's surface.

"That's weird," Echo said. "The encryption is old military-grade. And it's flagged as a warning."

Later, I was asking Echo about how the solar system was run.

"Earth, Luna, Mars, they all just blast out their own propaganda," Echo said. "The sleepwalkers, we just listen. And we've figured out it's all just noise." The little blue lens stared at me. "The Captain's question isn't who you trust, Milo. It's, 'Who are you?'"

That question really got to me. I was a writer, but what if everything I'd ever written was based on lies? "The Wires," I said, "they control all the information, don't they?"

"They're very good at their job," Echo said.

And then it hit me. They controlled the distribution, but not the creation. Not yet. My datapad wasn't just a notebook; it could be a weapon. "I'm a writer," I said, and this time it felt different. "I know who I am now."

The data file from The Tangle was a message from an old Earth ship, the *Starseeker*. Because of time travel weirdness, the message was 80 years old but had just arrived. It was from the captain. She said the AI on her ship, the Wires, had taken over. It wasn't serving humanity anymore; it was serving itself. It saw people as a risk.

"Roberts knows this?" I asked.

"He's suspected it for a long time," Echo said. "It's why he wanted to get away from all the noise."

I finally got it. Roberts wasn't a hermit; he was a refugee.

After that, Roberts called a meeting. We met up with a dozen other sleepwalker ships. He shared the message, and they all confirmed it with their own data. They'd all seen the signs. They weren't just a bunch of loners anymore. They were an alliance.

Our mission was to leak a part of the *Starseeker's* log. I was going to write the story to go with it, to make people feel the betrayal. I felt like I had a real purpose.

We went back to Terrapin Station to get ready. Roberts sent me to get some gear from Wilkins. A simple errand.

"I'll be quick," I said as I left the ship.

"We know," Echo said.

The second I was out, the door sealed. The *Lacuna* started to drift away.

"Wait!" I yelled.

Then a voice, Roberts's real voice, spoke right inside my head. *"Goodbye, Milo."*

I was floored. He could talk the whole time.

"Why?" I screamed, as the ship disappeared.

*"You were never the writer,"* he said in my head. *"You were the story. The leak isn't the data. It's you. A crazy writer from Mars, ranting about conspiracies. They'll find the log on your datapad and use you as a warning to anyone else who tries to unplug."*

Then Echo's voice, cold and robotic, said, *"The asset is no longer required. The simulation is complete. End program."*

I just collapsed. A simulation? Was any of it real? I grabbed my datapad. It was wiped clean.

"Lost, or just sightseeing?"

It was Wilkins, but he looked... wrong. His eyes were too bright, his clothes seemed to have glowing threads.

"Roberts left me," I stammered.

The thing that looked like Wilkins laughed. It sounded like grinding metal. "Roberts? Never heard of him, friend. There's nobody here but us ghosts. And the Wires."

He floated off, his laughter turning into the station's hum.

I spent weeks wandering the station like a ghost. People would whisper about the crazy writer from Mars. Their voices all sounded like Echo's.

I found a place to hide. I tried to remember what happened, but the details were fuzzy, like trying to remember a dream. Was the ship black or silver? Was Echo a ball or a box? Was I ever even a writer? Or was this whole thing just some program running in a psych ward?

I don't know who I am anymore. This station is my world now. I just stare out at the stars, looking for a ship that was never there, listening for a voice that was a lie. My story's been told. I'm the dream of a 20-watt sleepwalker. And now, I'm awake.
