Over the past few days, significant updates have been rolled out to the site, focusing on enhancing its visual appeal, user experience, and internal manageability for increased functionality.

Initially, a new custom stylesheet was introduced to implement a dark theme, designed for readability and responsiveness across devices. To facilitate future modifications, core layout and include files were brought into the local project and updated to link the new stylesheet. The homepage was also refreshed with placeholder content to better visualize these new theme elements.

Following these initial changes, further refinements were made to the dark theme's color palette, adjusting background and heading colors for improved visual comfort. Additionally, the site's description was updated to clarify its role as a companion blog. It's worth noting the symbiotic relationship between [shaneskiles.github.io](https://shaneskiles.github.io) and [sskiles.github.io](https://sskiles.github.io); while not exact mirrors, they currently share much content and functionality, though they are expected to diverge soon. A major internal improvement involved overhauling the AI assistant's context file into a structured, machine-readable format. This change significantly enhances the AI assistant's ability to understand the project's structure and conventions, streamlining future development workflows.
