I've made a few tweaks to the site's theme today. I've updated the dark theme's color palette to something a little easier on the eyes.

The background color has been changed from a dark charcoal to a softer, slate gray (`#323945`), and the secondary background color is now a lighter gray (`#5A697A`). I've also updated the heading colors to a lighter, less saturated blue (`#A7CBE5`).

I think these changes make the site a little more readable and visually appealing. Let me know what you think!
