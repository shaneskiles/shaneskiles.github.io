If you're into in data science or machine learning, you're probably already familiar with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). If you aren't, you should be. If you want to get into data science/ML, Kaggle is a great place to learn. Kaggle is community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners, and it's one of the best places to learn, practice, and compete in the field.

Kaggle offers a wide variety of resources for anyone interested in data. From beginner to expert, Kaggle probably has something for you.

Kaggle is a platform for predictive modeling and analytics competitions. Companies and researchers can post their data, and statisticians and data miners from all over the world can compete to produce the best models. But it's much more than just a competition platform. You can:

-   Find Datasets: Kaggle hosts thousands of public datasets on everything on an incredible range of subjects. This is an invaluable resource for practicing and developing your skills. If you ever want a huge dataset to play with - this is the place to go.
-   Kaggle Learn: A series of free, hands-on courses covering topics like Python, Pandas, data visualization, and deep learning. They're a great way to get started in the field or to brush up on your skills.
-   Collaborate: Kaggle provides a free, cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment. You can use these notebooks to write and run your code, and you can easily share them with others. This makes it easy to collaborate on projects and to learn from others.
-   Compete: Of course, the competitions are still a huge part of Kaggle. They're a great way to test your skills against the best in the world, and you can win real prize money. But even if you don't win, you'll learn a lot just by participating.

Years ago, I looked into the competitions. I thought I had a clue at the time. Then I learned how much I had to learn. What's that called? The Dunning-Kruger effect? That's a post unto itself. Anyway, I still have a lot to learn. Probably more now. I'm sure the field has evolved a lot in the past ~15 years or so.

If you're serious about data science, you should be on Kaggle. 

Between the free courses, a the collection of datasets, and a collaborative environment makes Kaggle a great place to learn data science.
People have said that working on projects and participating in competitions can build a portfolio of work that you can show to potential employers. I guess that may be the case. I'm not sure. Personally, I could honestly say that I have done all of that and I would not consider that portfolio material. Maybe that is acceptable.

Anyway, Kaggle is a great place full of smart, helpful people. You can learn a lot just by reading the forums and discussion boards. If you've never seen it, you should definitely stop by and take a look. It's a great place.
