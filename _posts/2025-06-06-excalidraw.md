I came across a neat tool called <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>
recently. Personally, I'm not all that
much of a whiteboard person, but I know people that live and die 
by the dry erase marker. This is a tool for both of us. If I ever need to
sketch something out, I'm going to do it here. 

Theoretically you can use it in a collaborative fashion with multiple people 
contributing - I've never looked into that. I haven't tried sharing any of my 
sketches with anyone, but I haven't had any issues myself.
It has a simple interface and is quite easy to use.

Anyway, I just wanted to let you know about it. Have fun.
