"The first walk is a simple delivery," Echo's voice filled the silent, white chamber of the *Lacuna*. "The Captain has been commissioned to move a piece of equipment from Terrapin Station to a... less stable habitat known as 'The Tangle'."

"A delivery?" I asked, surprised. I had imagined our first journey to be a pilgrimage to some remote, silent corner of the void. This felt mundane.

"The task is mundane," Echo corrected gently. "The journey is the purpose. The cargo is just an excuse."

As if on cue, the forward wall of the ship dissolved into a perfect view of space. But instead of a starfield, we were looking at the chaotic, spinning superstructure of Terrapin Station. A section of the station's hull peeled away, revealing a cargo bay. Inside, held by magnetic clamps, was a large, cylindrical object: a plasma engine core.

"The Tangle is a collective of scavengers and engineers," Echo explained as a series of magnetic pulses gently guided the engine core out of the bay and towards us. "They don't trust the corporate shipping lanes or the official channels. Too much chatter. Too many questions. When they need something moved quietly, they call on a sleepwalker."

The engine core floated towards our open hatch. It was a massive, complex piece of machinery, and I realized with a jolt that it wouldn't fit inside the *Lacuna*. But as it approached, the hull of our ship seemed to... unspool. The matte-black material flowed and reshaped itself, forming a secure external cradle that enveloped the engine. The process was silent, organic, and utterly impossible.

"The Captain prefers to travel light," Echo noted. "But the *Lacuna* is accommodating."

With the cargo secured, the ship sealed itself. The view of Terrapin Station vanished, replaced by the familiar, disorienting rush of warped spacetime. We were moving.

"Why do they need a new engine?" I asked, my eyes fixed on the swirling cosmos.

"The Tangle is falling apart," Echo said. "Literally. They need the engine to stabilize their orbit. Without it, their habitat will be torn apart by tidal forces within a few months."

The journey was long and silent. Roberts remained in his meditative state, a calm center in our strange, hurtling world. I watched the universe bend around us, the silence broken only by Echo's occasional, poetic observations about the nature of gravity, or the beauty of a distant nebula.

We were utterly alone. No other ships crossed our path. No signals, no chatter, no noise. This was the sleepwalker's world. A hidden network of trust and obligation that existed entirely outside the loud, chaotic sphere of the settled worlds. They were the quiet couriers of a society that had learned to distrust the official channels.

After what felt like days, we arrived. The Tangle was a breathtaking, terrifying sight. It was a chaotic web of interconnected ship hulls, asteroids, and salvaged station modules, all lashed together in a seemingly random configuration. It spun slowly, a wounded beast in the darkness.

"They are watching," Echo said. "They see us, but they will not hail. It is a matter of trust."

Roberts guided the *Lacuna* towards the heart of the chaotic structure. As we approached, a section of a massive, hollowed-out asteroid opened, revealing a docking bay. We released the engine core, and it was gently pulled inside by a series of tractor beams.

Our job was done. No words were exchanged. No docking fees were paid. A single, heavily encrypted data packet was transferred to our ship. Payment. But as it arrived, a subtle red light pulsed once on Echo's surface.

"That is unusual," the sphere noted, its voice losing its poetic tone for the first time. "The encryption is military-grade. Old Earth Fleet. And it is flagged as... a warning."

As we pulled away, I looked back at the strange, beautiful, chaotic mess of The Tangle. It was a monument to independence, to a group of people so determined to escape the noise of the universe that they had built their own world out of its scraps. And they had just paid us with a ghost.
